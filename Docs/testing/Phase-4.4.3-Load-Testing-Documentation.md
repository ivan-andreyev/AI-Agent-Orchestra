# Phase 4.4.3: Load Testing & Performance Validation

## Overview

**Task**: Verify system performance under load
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Phase**: 4.4.3 - Integration Testing & Validation
**Dependencies**: Phase 4.4.1 ✅, Phase 4.4.2 ✅, Phase 0.1/0.2 (Performance Baseline) ✅

## Objectives

This testing phase validates that the AI Agent Orchestra system maintains performance and stability under realistic load conditions. We will test concurrent task processing, multi-agent operations, and UI responsiveness under stress.

## Load Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Task Volume (10+ tasks queued simultaneously)

**Purpose**: Verify task queuing and assignment performance with high task volume
**Load Profile**: 10-20 tasks queued within 5 seconds
**Expected Behavior**:
- All tasks successfully queued
- Task assignment completes within <2s per task (Phase 0.1 threshold)
- No task loss or status inconsistencies
- UI remains responsive throughout

**Performance Thresholds** (from Phase 0.1 baseline):
- Task assignment: <2000ms per task
- UI component updates: <1000ms
- Memory usage: Within 10% of baseline
- No component render degradation >10%

**Test Steps**:
1. Start Orchestra.API and Orchestra.Web applications
2. Run automated load test script: `Test-Phase4-LoadTesting.ps1 -Scenario HighTaskVolume`
3. Monitor PerformanceMonitor component in UI during test execution
4. Verify all tasks transition through correct states: Pending → Assigned → InProgress → Completed
5. Check for any errors in console or SignalR disconnections
6. Validate memory usage remains stable after task completion

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 100% task queuing success rate (no failures)
- ✅ Average task assignment time <2s
- ✅ Maximum task assignment time <5s (99th percentile)
- ✅ UI updates within 1s throughout test
- ✅ Memory usage increase <10% from baseline
- ✅ Zero task status inconsistencies or lost tasks

### Scenario 2: Concurrent Agent Operations (5+ agents working simultaneously)

**Purpose**: Verify orchestrator performance with multiple agents processing tasks in parallel
**Load Profile**: 5-10 agents active, each processing 2-5 tasks concurrently
**Expected Behavior**:
- Agents properly isolated - no task assignment conflicts
- Correct agent-task matching based on repository/specialization
- Status updates propagate correctly to UI for all agents
- No deadlocks or race conditions in orchestrator

**Performance Thresholds**:
- Agent status updates: <500ms propagation to UI
- Task assignment decisions: <200ms per agent
- Concurrent task processing: No degradation vs single agent
- Memory per agent: Linear scaling (no memory leaks)

**Test Steps**:
1. Register 5-10 test agents with different capabilities/repositories
2. Run automated load test: `Test-Phase4-LoadTesting.ps1 -Scenario ConcurrentAgents`
3. Monitor agent sidebar for proper status display during concurrent processing
4. Verify correct task distribution across agents
5. Check for any deadlocks, race conditions, or synchronization issues
6. Validate memory scaling is linear (2x agents ≈ 2x memory, not exponential)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All agents receive appropriate tasks (no starvation)
- ✅ Zero task assignment conflicts (same task to multiple agents)
- ✅ Agent status updates visible within 500ms
- ✅ Task distribution follows priority and capability rules
- ✅ No deadlocks or exceptions in orchestrator
- ✅ Memory scaling is linear (<20% overhead per additional agent)

### Scenario 3: UI Stress Testing (Multiple users accessing QuickActions)

**Purpose**: Verify UI responsiveness and API stability with concurrent user interactions
**Load Profile**: 3-5 simulated users creating tasks and monitoring UI simultaneously
**Expected Behavior**:
- UI remains responsive during concurrent API calls
- No race conditions in UI state management
- QuickActions component handles concurrent submissions
- SignalR hub scales to multiple connections

**Performance Thresholds**:
- API response time: <500ms for task queuing under load
- UI component render: <100ms per update even with concurrent activity
- SignalR message latency: <200ms end-to-end
- Browser memory: Stable (no memory leaks from UI updates)

**Test Steps**:
1. Open 3-5 browser tabs/windows to Orchestra.Web
2. Run automated UI stress test: `Test-Phase4-LoadTesting.ps1 -Scenario UIStress`
3. Simulate concurrent task creation through QuickActions in all tabs
4. Monitor browser DevTools Performance tab for UI responsiveness
5. Check SignalR hub connections remain stable (no disconnects)
6. Verify all tabs show consistent state (all users see same task list)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All API calls complete successfully (no timeouts or 5xx errors)
- ✅ UI remains interactive throughout (<100ms input response)
- ✅ Component renders stay within performance budget (<100ms)
- ✅ SignalR connections remain stable (0 disconnections)
- ✅ State consistency across all clients (eventual consistency <1s)
- ✅ Browser memory stable (no leaks from repeated updates)

### Scenario 4: Combined Load (Integrated Stress Test)

**Purpose**: Validate system stability under realistic combined load
**Load Profile**: 10+ tasks + 5+ agents + 3+ users simultaneously
**Expected Behavior**:
- System maintains performance under realistic production load
- All components work correctly together under stress
- Graceful degradation if load exceeds capacity (no crashes)
- Performance monitoring correctly reports system state

**Performance Thresholds**:
- Overall system responsiveness: <2s for any user action
- Task throughput: >5 tasks/minute with 5 agents
- System stability: 100% uptime during 5-minute test
- Error rate: <1% (mostly expected validation errors, not system failures)

**Test Steps**:
1. Run comprehensive load test: `Test-Phase4-LoadTesting.ps1 -Scenario Combined`
2. Monitor all performance metrics in PerformanceMonitor component
3. Check system logs for errors, warnings, or performance issues
4. Verify graceful behavior if system approaches capacity limits
5. Ensure all components recover correctly after load subsides

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ System remains responsive throughout entire test duration
- ✅ Task throughput meets minimum threshold (>5 tasks/min)
- ✅ Zero crashes or unhandled exceptions
- ✅ Performance monitoring shows accurate real-time metrics
- ✅ System recovers to baseline performance after load ends
- ✅ All completed tasks show correct final status

## Regression Testing

**Purpose**: Verify no performance degradation from Phase 0 baseline

### Baseline Comparison (from Phase 0.1)

**Original Baseline Metrics** (established in Phase 0.1):
- Component render time: Measured baseline for Home, TaskQueue, AgentSidebar
- Task assignment time: Established <2s threshold
- UI responsiveness: <1s component update threshold
- Memory usage: Baseline memory footprint documented

**Regression Test Procedure**:
1. Re-run Phase 0.1 performance measurements after load testing
2. Compare current metrics to original baseline
3. Calculate percentage change for each metric
4. Flag any degradation >10% as potential regression

**Acceptable Variance**:
- Component render time: ±10% from baseline
- Task assignment time: Must remain <2s (absolute threshold)
- Memory usage: ±10% from baseline
- UI updates: Must remain <1s (absolute threshold)

**Regression Success Criteria**:
- ✅ No metric degrades >10% from Phase 0.1 baseline
- ✅ All absolute thresholds still met (<2s assignment, <1s UI updates)
- ✅ Memory footprint remains within acceptable range
- ✅ No new performance warnings or bottlenecks introduced
