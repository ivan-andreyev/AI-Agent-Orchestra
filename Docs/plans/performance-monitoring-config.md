# Performance Monitoring Configuration - Phase 0.2

**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Task**: Phase 0.2 - Performance Monitoring Setup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

This document describes the continuous performance monitoring system implemented in Phase 0.2 of the UI-Fixes-WorkPlan. The system provides automated performance tracking with regression detection based on the baseline metrics established in Phase 0.1.

## Performance Monitoring Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PerformanceMonitoringService**
   - Central service for performance measurement and threshold tracking
   - Location: `src/Orchestra.Web/Services/PerformanceMonitoringService.cs`
   - Features: API monitoring, component render tracking, statistics calculation monitoring

2. **MonitoredOrchestratorService**
   - Performance-aware wrapper for OrchestratorService
   - Location: `src/Orchestra.Web/Services/MonitoredOrchestratorService.cs`
   - Features: Automatic API call monitoring, regression detection, logging

3. **PerformanceMonitor Component**
   - Real-time UI display of performance metrics
   - Location: `src/Orchestra.Web/Components/PerformanceMonitor.razor`
   - Features: Live metrics display, regression alerts, detailed performance breakdown

## Performance Thresholds (Based on Phase 0.1 Baseline)

### API Response Time Thresholds (200% of baseline)
```csharp
ApiResponseTime = new ThresholdConfig
{
    StateEndpoint = 165,        // Current: 78.33 ms
    AgentsEndpoint = 130,       // Current: 64.72 ms
    RepositoriesEndpoint = 165, // Current: 81.10 ms
    TaskQueueEndpoint = 215     // Current: 106.30 ms (needs fixing)
}
```

### Component Performance Targets (10% increase tolerance)
```csharp
ComponentPerformance = new ThresholdConfig
{
    InitialPageLoad = 2000,         // Target for Phase 1
    StatisticsCalculation = 100,    // 221 agent aggregation
    ComponentRerender = 50,         // Per component
    StateUpdatePropagation = 1000   // Plan requirement
}
```

### Memory Usage Thresholds (10% increase tolerance)
```csharp
MemoryUsage = new ThresholdConfig
{
    BaselineIncrease = 10,  // Percentage
    MaxMemoryGrowth = 50    // MB
}
```

## Monitoring Implementation

### 1. API Performance Monitoring

**Monitored Endpoints:**
- `GET /state` - Orchestrator state retrieval
- `GET /agents` - Agent list retrieval
- `GET /repositories` - Repository list retrieval
- `POST /tasks/queue` - Task submission
- `GET /agents/{sessionId}/history` - Agent history retrieval
- `POST /refresh` - Agent refresh operation

**Implementation:**
```csharp
var result = await _performanceService.MeasureApiResponseAsync("state", async () =>
{
    var state = await _orchestratorService.GetStateAsync();
    if (state == null)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Failed to retrieve orchestrator state");
    }
});
```

### 2. Component Render Monitoring

**Monitored Components:**
- Home.razor (main page)
- RepositorySelector component
- AgentSidebar component
- TaskQueue component
- AgentHistory component

**Implementation:**
```csharp
var result = _performanceService.MeasureComponentRender("Home", () =>
{
    // Component render action
});
```

### 3. Statistics Calculation Monitoring

**Monitored Calculations:**
- Total agents count (221 agent aggregation)
- Working agents count
- Idle agents count
- Error agents count
- Offline agents count

**Implementation:**
```csharp
private int GetTotalAgentsCount()
{
    return OrchestratorService.MeasureStatisticsCalculation(() =>
        _repositories?.Values.Sum(r => r.Agents.Count) ?? _state?.Agents.Count ?? 0,
        "total_agents_count"
    );
}
```

## Regression Detection System

### Automatic Detection
- Real-time threshold checking during measurement
- Automatic logging of performance regressions
- Warning indicators in the UI

### Regression Criteria
- **API Calls**: Response time exceeds 200% of baseline
- **Component Renders**: Render time exceeds 10% of baseline
- **Statistics**: Calculation time exceeds 100ms threshold

### Logging and Alerts
```csharp
if (result.Duration > threshold)
{
    _logger.LogWarning("API Performance Regression Detected: {Endpoint} took {Duration}ms (threshold: {Threshold}ms)",
        endpoint, result.Duration, threshold);
    result.IsRegression = true;
}
```

## User Interface Integration

### Performance Monitor Component
- **Location**: Integrated into sidebar of Home.razor
- **Refresh Rate**: 10-second intervals
- **Display Features**:
  - Overall performance status (OK/Warning)
  - Count of API and component metrics
  - Number of regressions detected
  - Detailed metrics view (expandable)
  - Last update timestamp

### Visual Indicators
- ✅ Green status for normal performance
- ⚠️ Yellow/Orange for detected regressions
- Metric-specific warnings in detailed view
- Real-time updates every 10 seconds

## Configuration and Setup

### Dependency Injection Registration
```csharp
// Register performance monitoring services (Phase 0.2 implementation)
builder.Services.AddScoped<PerformanceMonitoringService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<OrchestratorService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<MonitoredOrchestratorService>();

// Configure logging for performance monitoring
builder.Services.AddLogging();
```

### Component Integration
```razor
@inject MonitoredOrchestratorService OrchestratorService
@inject PerformanceMonitoringService PerformanceService

<!-- Performance Monitoring Section (Phase 0.2) -->
<div class="sidebar-section performance-monitoring-section">
    <PerformanceMonitor />
</div>
```
