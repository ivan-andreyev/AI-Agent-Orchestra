## Test Plan

### Test Dataset Requirements

**Sample Plans Needed**:
- [ ] 5 READY plans (score ≥90%) - Expected to pass validation

- [ ] 5 Edge case plans (specific scenarios)

**Plan Characteristics to Cover**:
- [ ] Single-file plans (simple structure)
- [ ] Multi-file plans with proper catalogization
- [ ] Plans with architectural components (triggers architecture-documenter)
- [ ] Plans with >5 tasks (triggers parallel-plan-optimizer)
- [ ] Plans with over-complex tasks (>30 tool calls)
- [ ] Plans with missing integration steps
- [ ] Plans with GOLDEN RULE violations
- [ ] Plans exceeding 400 lines
- [ ] Plans with broken parent/child references
- [ ] Plans with TODO-heavy architecture (valid "Plan ≠ Realization")
- [ ] Plans with full implementation code (invalid)
