## Test 4: Low Improvement Rate Escalation

**Test Scenario 4: Low Improvement Escalation Trigger**:
```markdown
## Test Scenario 4: Low Improvement Rate Trigger

### Setup
- 10 issues in Cycle 1 (mix of P0, P1, P2)
- Mock executor fixes only 3 issues (30% improvement)

### Execution
1. Cycle 1: 10 issues found
2. Cycle 2: 7 issues remain (3 fixed, 30% improvement)
3. Improvement rate <50% → Escalation triggered

### Expected Results
- Escalation reason: "Low improvement rate (<50%)"
- Escalation report includes analysis of persistent issues
- Recommendations focus on why issues weren't fixed

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] Improvement rate = 30% (3/10)
- [ ] Escalation triggered (threshold 50%)
- [ ] Escalation report generated
- [ ] Persistent issues analyzed
- [ ] Recommendations address root causes
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Low improvement rate detected
- [ ] Escalation trigger functional
- [ ] Root cause analysis targets persistent issues
- [ ] Recommendations actionable

## Test 5: Negative Net Improvement Escalation

**Test Scenario 5: Regression Detection**:
```markdown
## Test Scenario 5: Negative Net Improvement (Regressions)

### Setup
- Cycle 1: 8 issues found
- Mock executor "fixes" 5 issues but introduces 7 new issues

### Execution
1. Cycle 1: 8 issues
2. Cycle 2: 10 issues (5 fixed, 7 new)
3. Net improvement = -2 (negative) → Escalation

### Expected Results
- Escalation reason: "Negative net improvement (regressions introduced)"
- Report highlights new issues introduced
- Root cause analysis focuses on why fixes caused regressions

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] Issues fixed = 5
- [ ] New issues = 7
- [ ] Net improvement = -2

- [ ] New issues clearly listed
- [ ] Root cause analysis identifies regression patterns
```
