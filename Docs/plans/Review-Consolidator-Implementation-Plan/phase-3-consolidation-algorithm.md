**Deliverables**: Complete consolidation algorithm in consolidation-algorithm.md

**Progress**: 100% (3/3 tasks complete) ✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETE
- Task 3.1: Issue Deduplication Engine ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-16)

## Overview

Phase 3 implements the core consolidation algorithm that transforms raw reviewer outputs into a unified, deduplicated, and prioritized set of actionable issues. This phase eliminates 60-80% duplicate issues while preserving critical information and providing intelligent priority aggregation.

**Key Objectives**:
- Deduplicate issues using exact match (100% accuracy) and semantic similarity (>80% threshold)
- Aggregate priorities using reviewer consensus (P0 if ANY, P1 if MAJORITY)
- Synthesize actionable recommendations ranked by frequency and impact
- Achieve 60-80% deduplication ratio while maintaining accuracy

**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: Medium
**Completed**: 2025-10-16
**Validation**: pre-completion-validator 95% confidence (APPROVED)

Implements intelligent priority rules:
- P0 if ANY reviewer marks critical
- P1 if MAJORITY (≥50%) marks warning
- P2 as default fallback
- Confidence weighting by reviewer expertise
- Priority overrides (security → P0, breaking changes → P0)

**Results**:
- Updated consolidation-algorithm.md with priority aggregation system (+1,283 lines)
- Priority rules engine (ANY P0, MAJORITY P1, DEFAULT P2)
- Confidence weighting with domain expertise (test-healer 1.5x, code-principles 1.3x, code-style 1.2x)

**Duration**: 2 hours | **Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Completed**: 2025-10-16
**Validation**: pre-completion-validator 95% confidence (APPROVED)

Synthesizes actionable recommendations:
- Extract recommendations from issues (≥60% confidence)
- Categorize by theme (refactoring, testing, documentation, performance, security)
- Generate prioritized action items
- Build top 5 common themes summary

**Results**:
- Updated consolidation-algorithm.md with recommendation synthesis system (+1,622 lines)
- Recommendation extractor with 6 theme categories and 54+ keywords
- Action item generator with priority+effort sorting and quick win detection
- Theme summary builder with top 5 patterns and reviewer agreement tracking
- synthesizeRecommendations() master workflow function

- Execution statistics (timing, confidence, status)

**Outputs to Phase 4**:
- ConsolidatedIssue[] array (deduplicated, prioritized)
- Recommendation[] array (themed, ranked)
- ActionItem[] array (sorted by priority and effort)
- Deduplication statistics

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Deduplication ratio: 60-80% reduction in issue count
- [ ] Exact match deduplication: 100% accuracy
- [ ] Semantic similarity grouping: >90% accuracy (0.80 threshold)
- [ ] Priority aggregation: P0 if ANY, P1 if MAJORITY
- [ ] Confidence weighting reflects reviewer expertise
- [ ] Recommendation categorization: >90% accuracy
- [ ] Processing time: <5 seconds for 1000 issues

---

## Validation Tests

1. **Deduplication Accuracy Test**: 100 issues (50% duplicates) → 50-55 unique issues
2. **Priority Aggregation Test**: Mixed priorities → correct P0/P1/P2 classification
3. **Confidence Calculation Test**: Weighted average within 5% of manual calculation
4. **Semantic Similarity Test**: Boundary cases (79% vs 81% similarity)

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Algorithm complexity and accuracy
- Mitigation: Extensive testing with real reviewer outputs
- Contingency: Manual tuning of similarity threshold (0.75-0.85 range)
