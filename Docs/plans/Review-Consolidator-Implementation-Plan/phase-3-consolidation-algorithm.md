# Phase 3: Consolidation Algorithm Implementation

**Parent Plan**: [Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md](../Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md)

**Duration**: Day 3 (8-10 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 (Parallel Execution) complete
**Deliverables**: Complete consolidation algorithm in consolidation-algorithm.md

---

## Overview

Phase 3 implements the core consolidation algorithm that transforms raw reviewer outputs into a unified, deduplicated, and prioritized set of actionable issues. This phase eliminates 60-80% duplicate issues while preserving critical information and providing intelligent priority aggregation.

**Key Objectives**:
- Deduplicate issues using exact match (100% accuracy) and semantic similarity (>80% threshold)
- Aggregate priorities using reviewer consensus (P0 if ANY, P1 if MAJORITY)
- Synthesize actionable recommendations ranked by frequency and impact
- Achieve 60-80% deduplication ratio while maintaining accuracy

## Task Structure

### [Task 3.1: Issue Deduplication Engine](phase-3-consolidation-algorithm/task-3.1-deduplication-engine.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: High

Implements two-stage deduplication:
- Exact match deduplication (file + line + rule hash)
- Semantic similarity using Levenshtein distance algorithm (0.80 threshold)
- Issue merging with confidence averaging and reviewer agreement tracking
- Deduplication statistics reporting

**Key Deliverable**: Deduplication algorithm achieving 60-80% reduction

---

### [Task 3.2: Priority Aggregation Logic](phase-3-consolidation-algorithm/task-3.2-priority-aggregation.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: Medium

Implements intelligent priority rules:
- P0 if ANY reviewer marks critical
- P1 if MAJORITY (≥50%) marks warning
- P2 as default fallback
- Confidence weighting by reviewer expertise
- Priority overrides (security → P0, breaking changes → P0)

**Key Deliverable**: Priority aggregation system with conflict resolution

---

### [Task 3.3: Recommendation Synthesis](phase-3-consolidation-algorithm/task-3.3-recommendation-synthesis.md)
**Duration**: 2 hours | **Complexity**: Low-Medium

Synthesizes actionable recommendations:
- Extract recommendations from issues (≥60% confidence)
- Categorize by theme (refactoring, testing, documentation, performance, security)
- Generate prioritized action items
- Build top 5 common themes summary

**Key Deliverable**: Recommendation synthesis with theme analysis

---

## Dependencies

**Inputs from Phase 2**:
- ReviewResult[] array from all reviewers
- Issue[] collection with metadata
- Execution statistics (timing, confidence, status)

**Outputs to Phase 4**:
- ConsolidatedIssue[] array (deduplicated, prioritized)
- Recommendation[] array (themed, ranked)
- ActionItem[] array (sorted by priority and effort)
- Deduplication statistics

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Deduplication ratio: 60-80% reduction in issue count
- [ ] Exact match deduplication: 100% accuracy
- [ ] Semantic similarity grouping: >90% accuracy (0.80 threshold)
- [ ] Priority aggregation: P0 if ANY, P1 if MAJORITY
- [ ] Confidence weighting reflects reviewer expertise
- [ ] Recommendation categorization: >90% accuracy
- [ ] Processing time: <5 seconds for 1000 issues

---

## Validation Tests

1. **Deduplication Accuracy Test**: 100 issues (50% duplicates) → 50-55 unique issues
2. **Priority Aggregation Test**: Mixed priorities → correct P0/P1/P2 classification
3. **Confidence Calculation Test**: Weighted average within 5% of manual calculation
4. **Semantic Similarity Test**: Boundary cases (79% vs 81% similarity)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Algorithm complexity and accuracy
- Mitigation: Extensive testing with real reviewer outputs
- Contingency: Manual tuning of similarity threshold (0.75-0.85 range)

**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Estimated Completion**: 8-10 hours total
