# Task 2.3: Performance Optimization

**Parent**: [Phase 2: Parallel Execution Engine](../phase-2-parallel-execution.md)

**Duration**: 2 hours
**Complexity**: 6-8 tool calls
**Deliverables**: Performance optimization specifications in prompt.md

---

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Result Caching

```markdown
- Cache reviewer results for 15 minutes
- Key: hash(files + reviewer + version)
- Invalidate on file changes
- Skip re-review if cache hit
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Cache key generation from file list hash
- [ ] 15-minute TTL for cached results
- [ ] Automatic invalidation on file modifications
- [ ] Cache hit metrics tracking

---

### 2. Early Termination

```markdown
- IF any reviewer finds P0 (critical) issues:
  - Cancel remaining reviewers
  - Return immediate report with P0 issues
  - Reason: P0 must be fixed before other issues matter
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] P0 issue detection during execution
- [ ] Graceful cancellation of pending reviewers
- [ ] Partial report generation with P0 issues only
- [ ] User notification of early termination

---

### 3. Resource Management

```markdown
- Maximum parallel reviewers: 3-5 (configurable)
- Queue additional reviewers if limit reached
- Monitor system resources (memory, CPU)
- Throttle if resource usage >80%
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Configurable concurrency limit (default: 3)
- [ ] Queue mechanism for excess reviewers
- [ ] System resource monitoring (memory/CPU)
- [ ] Automatic throttling at 80% resource usage

---

### 4. Progressive Results

```markdown
- Stream results as reviewers complete
- Don't wait for all reviewers to finish
- Update report incrementally
- Allow user to see partial results
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Result streaming as reviewers complete
- [ ] Incremental report updates
- [ ] Real-time progress display
- [ ] Partial result presentation

---

## Integration Tests

### Test Scenarios (1 hour)

#### 1. Parallel Execution Test
```markdown
- Input: 10 C# files
- Expected: 3 reviewers launch simultaneously
- Verify: Execution time <2x single reviewer time
- Check: All Task calls in single message
```

#### 2. Timeout Handling Test
```markdown
- Simulate: One reviewer takes >5 minutes
- Expected: Timeout triggered, partial results returned
- Verify: Other reviewers complete normally
- Check: Report indicates timeout status
```

#### 3. Cache Effectiveness Test
```markdown
- First run: Review 20 files (no cache)
- Second run: Same 20 files (cache hit)
- Expected: Second run <10% of first run time
- Verify: Cache metrics show hits
```

#### 4. Reviewer Selection Test
```markdown
- Input: Mixed files (.cs, .Tests.cs, .json, .md)
- Expected: Correct reviewers selected per file type
- Verify: test-healer only for test files
- Check: No reviewers for .json/.md files
```

## Validation Checklist

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Parallel execution reduces time by >60%
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents hanging
- [ ] Cache reduces re-review time by >90%
- [ ] Memory usage <500MB for 100 files

### Correctness Requirements
- [ ] All reviewers launch in single message
- [ ] Results collected from all non-timeout reviewers
- [ ] Partial results handled gracefully
- [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Task tool parallel pattern documented
- [ ] Result format standardized across reviewers
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Progress tracking informative

## Next Phase Prerequisites

Before proceeding to Phase 3:
- [ ] Parallel execution tested successfully
- [ ] Result collection validated
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] No race conditions or deadlocks
