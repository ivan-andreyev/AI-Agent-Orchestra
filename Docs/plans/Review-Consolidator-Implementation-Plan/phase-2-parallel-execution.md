# Phase 2: Parallel Execution Engine

**Parent Plan**: [Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md](../Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md)

**Duration**: Day 2 (8-10 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 specifications complete
**Deliverables**: Parallel execution engine specifications in prompt.md

---

## Overview

Phase 2 implements the parallel execution engine that launches multiple reviewers simultaneously, collects their results, and optimizes performance through caching and resource management. This phase is critical for achieving 60%+ time reduction through parallel processing.

**Key Objectives**:
- Launch 3-5 reviewers in parallel using Task tool pattern
- Implement robust result collection from heterogeneous formats (JSON, Markdown, XML)
- Achieve 60%+ time reduction vs sequential execution
- Handle timeouts and partial results gracefully

## Task Structure

### [Task 2.1: Parallel Review Orchestrator](phase-2-parallel-execution/task-2.1-parallel-launcher.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: High

Implements the core parallel execution logic:
- Single-message multi-Task pattern for simultaneous reviewer launch
- Dynamic reviewer selection based on file types
- Execution monitoring with timeout detection (5 minutes)
- Fallback to sequential execution if parallel fails

**Key Deliverable**: Parallel orchestration specifications in prompt.md

---

### [Task 2.2: Result Collection Engine](phase-2-parallel-execution/task-2.2-result-collection.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: Medium-High

Creates parsers for each reviewer output format:
- JSON parser for code-style-reviewer (95% confidence)
- Markdown parser for code-principles-reviewer (85% confidence)
- XML/hybrid parser for test-healer (90% confidence)
- Unified error handling with fallback to partial results
- In-memory result caching with 15-minute TTL

**Key Deliverable**: Result collection framework in consolidation-algorithm.md

---

### [Task 2.3: Performance Optimization](phase-2-parallel-execution/task-2.3-performance-optimization.md)
**Duration**: 2 hours | **Complexity**: Low-Medium

Optimizes execution performance:
- Result caching (90%+ time reduction on re-reviews)
- Early termination on P0 issues
- Resource management (3-5 reviewer concurrency limit)
- Progressive result streaming

**Key Deliverable**: Performance optimization specifications in prompt.md

---

## Dependencies

**Inputs from Phase 1**:
- Agent interface definitions
- File type mapping specifications
- Timeout and error handling policies

**Outputs to Phase 3**:
- Standardized ReviewResult[] array
- Issue[] collection ready for deduplication
- Execution metadata (timing, status, confidence)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Parallel execution reduces review time by >60%
- [ ] All reviewers launch in single message (no sequential delays)
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents hanging (5-minute limit per reviewer)
- [ ] Result parsing achieves >95% accuracy
- [ ] Cache reduces re-review time by >90%
- [ ] Memory usage <500MB for 100 files
- [ ] Partial results handled gracefully (no failures on timeout)

---

## Integration Tests

1. **Parallel Execution Test**: 10 files → 3 reviewers → <2x single reviewer time
2. **Timeout Handling Test**: Simulated 5-minute delay → partial results returned
3. **Cache Effectiveness Test**: Re-review 20 files → <10% original time
4. **Reviewer Selection Test**: Mixed file types → correct reviewer assignment

---

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Parallel execution complexity
- Mitigation: Comprehensive timeout handling and fallback to sequential
- Contingency: Detailed error logging for debugging race conditions

---

**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Estimated Completion**: 8-10 hours total
