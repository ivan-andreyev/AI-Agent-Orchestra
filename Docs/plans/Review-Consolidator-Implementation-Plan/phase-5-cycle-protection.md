## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Cycle ID Synchronization** (Medium)
   - Risk: Cycle ID lost between agent invocations
   - Mitigation: Pass cycle ID in both prompt and context
   - Impact: High if lost (cycle tracking breaks)

2. **Escalation False Positives** (Low)
   - Risk: Escalation triggers too aggressively
   - Mitigation: Conservative thresholds (50% improvement rate)
   - Impact: Medium (unnecessary escalations)

3. **Agent Transition Ambiguity** (Low)
   - Risk: Unclear which agent to invoke next
   - Mitigation: Clear priority-based recommendations
   - Impact: Low (recommendations are guidance, not enforcement)

---

## Integration Points

### Upstream Agents (Invoke review-consolidator)
- **plan-task-executor** (CRITICAL): After code changes
- **plan-task-completer** (RECOMMENDED): Before task completion
- **User** (OPTIONAL): Ad-hoc manual invocations

### Downstream Agents (Invoked by review-consolidator)
- **plan-task-executor** (CRITICAL if P0): Fix critical issues

   - code-principles-reviewer finds 5 P0 issues
   - Total: 15 consolidated issues
   - Generate initial report with all findings
2. **Fix Phase**: Mock plan-task-executor receives Cycle 1 report
   - Fixes all 5 P0 issues (nullable checks added, error handling implemented)
   - Leaves P1/P2 issues unresolved
3. **Cycle 2**: review-consolidator re-reviews with same cycle ID
   - Iteration counter = 2
   - P0 issues no longer present (5 fixed)

### Test 4: Low Improvement Rate Escalation

**Objective**: Verify escalation triggers when improvement rate falls below 50% threshold

**Setup**:
- 10 issues in Cycle 1 (mixed priorities):
  - 3 P0 (Critical): Missing null checks, unhandled exceptions
  - 4 P1 (Important): Code style violations, missing docs
  - 3 P2 (Minor): Formatting issues
- Mock executor configured to fix only 3 issues (intentional low improvement)

**Execution Steps**:
1. **Cycle 1**: review-consolidator finds 10 issues
   - 3 P0, 4 P1, 3 P2
   - All issues documented in report
2. **Limited Fix**: Mock executor fixes only 3 issues
   - Fixes 1 P0 issue (33% P0 improvement)
   - Fixes 2 P1 issues (50% P1 improvement)
   - Leaves all P2 issues unresolved
   - Overall improvement: 30% (3/10)
3. **Cycle 2**: review-consolidator re-reviews
   - 7 issues remain (2 P0, 2 P1, 3 P2)
   - 3 issues fixed (1 P0, 2 P1)
   - Improvement rate = 30%
4. **Escalation Check**: 30% < 50% threshold → Escalate

**Expected Results**:
- Escalation triggered with reason: "Low improvement rate (<50%)"
- Escalation report includes detailed analysis of persistent issues
- Recommendations focus on why issues weren't fixed:
  - Complexity analysis of unresolved issues
  - Blocker identification (missing info, dependencies, etc.)
  - Suggested alternative approaches
- Root cause analysis targets fixability challenges

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Improvement rate calculated correctly = 30% (3/10)
- [ ] Escalation triggered (threshold 50%)
- [ ] Escalation reason correct: "Low improvement rate"
- [ ] Escalation report generated
- [ ] Persistent issues analyzed (7 remaining)

- [ ] Recommendations focus on improving fixability
- [ ] Alternative approaches suggested (manual review, different tools)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Low improvement rate detected accurately
- [ ] Escalation trigger functional (<50% threshold)
- [ ] Root cause analysis targets persistent issues specifically
- [ ] Recommendations actionable and specific
- [ ] Report distinguishes between fixed and persistent issues

### Test 5: Negative Net Improvement Escalation

**Objective**: Verify escalation triggers when fixes introduce more issues than they resolve (regressions)

**Setup**:
- Cycle 1: 8 issues in test files
  - 3 P0: Null reference issues
  - 5 P1: Code style issues
- Mock executor configured to "fix" issues but introduce new ones:
  - Fixes 5 issues but introduces 7 new issues
  - Net result: -2 (regression)

**Execution Steps**:
1. **Cycle 1**: review-consolidator finds 8 issues
   - Issues tracked with unique IDs
   - Baseline established
2. **Problematic Fix**: Mock executor attempts fixes
   - Fixes 3 P0 null reference issues → introduces 4 new P0 issues (race conditions)
   - Fixes 2 P1 style issues → introduces 3 new P1 issues (complexity violations)
   - Net improvement = -2 (worse than before)
3. **Cycle 2**: review-consolidator re-reviews
   - Total issues = 10 (8 - 5 + 7)
   - Fixed issues = 5 (tracked by ID)
   - New issues = 7 (new IDs not present in Cycle 1)
   - Net improvement = -2
4. **Escalation**: Negative net improvement → Escalate

**Expected Results**:
- Escalation triggered with reason: "Negative net improvement (regressions introduced)"
- Report clearly highlights new issues introduced in Cycle 2
- Root cause analysis focuses on why fixes caused regressions:
  - Overly aggressive fixes without side-effect analysis
  - Missing test coverage for fixed code
  - Lack of integration testing
- Recommendations include regression prevention strategies

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Issues fixed tracked accurately = 5
- [ ] New issues detected and tracked = 7
- [ ] Net improvement calculated correctly = -2
- [ ] Escalation triggered on negative net improvement
- [ ] New issues clearly listed and distinguished from fixed issues
- [ ] Root cause analysis identifies regression patterns
- [ ] Recommendations address regression prevention
- [ ] Cycle comparison shows issue ID changes (fixed vs new)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Regression detection functional (new issues identified)
- [ ] Negative net improvement triggers escalation
- [ ] New issues tracked separately from fixed issues
- [ ] Root cause analysis addresses regression causes specifically
- [ ] Recommendations include testing and validation strategies

3. **Cycle 2**: User invokes review-consolidator again
   - Passes same cycle ID from Cycle 1
   - Iteration counter increments to 2
   - Re-reviews fixed files
   - Detects fixed issues (should be 0 P0 remaining)
4. **Transition**: review-consolidator recommends next agent
