# Phase 5: Cycle Protection & Integration (Coordinator)

**Parent Plan**: [Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md](../Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md)

**Duration**: Day 5 (8-10 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 (Report Generation) complete
**Deliverables**: Cycle protection mechanisms and integration specifications

---

## Overview

This phase implements the cycle protection system to prevent infinite review-fix loops and establishes integration points with other agents in the orchestration workflow. The phase is decomposed into 3 major tasks handled in separate files.

**Key Goals**:
- Implement max 2 review cycle limit
- Create escalation mechanism for unresolved issues
- Define agent transition matrix (upstream/downstream)
- Validate cycle protection with integration tests

---

## Task Files

### Task 5.1: Review Cycle Management
**File**: [task-5.1-cycle-management.md](phase-5-cycle-protection/task-5.1-cycle-management.md)

**Summary**: Implements cycle tracking system, escalation mechanism, and cycle visualization

**Key Components**:
- Cycle tracking data structure with iteration counter
- Escalation triggers (max cycles, low improvement, negative net)
- Cycle progress visualization with improvement metrics
- Issue tracking across cycles (fixed/persistent/new)

**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Deliverables**: Cycle tracker, escalation report generator, visualization system

---

### Task 5.2: Agent Transition Matrix Integration
**File**: [task-5.2-agent-transitions.md](phase-5-cycle-protection/task-5.2-agent-transitions.md)

**Summary**: Defines upstream and downstream agent transitions with automatic recommendations

**Key Components**:
- Upstream transitions (plan-task-executor → review-consolidator)
- Downstream transitions (review-consolidator → plan-task-executor/pre-completion-validator)
- Automatic transition recommendation generation
- Agent transition matrix for AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Deliverables**: Agent transition specifications, recommendation templates

---

### Task 5.3: Integration Testing Setup
**File**: [task-5.3-integration-testing.md](phase-5-cycle-protection/task-5.3-integration-testing.md)

**Summary**: Comprehensive integration test scenarios for cycle protection and agent integration

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Full review-fix-review cycle (happy path)
2. Maximum cycles escalation trigger
3. Integration with real reviewers (parallel execution)
4. Low improvement rate escalation
5. Negative net improvement (regression detection)
6. End-to-end cycle with real agents

**Duration**: 2 hours
**Deliverables**: Test scenarios, validation checklist, test execution template

---

## Execution Sequence

The tasks must be executed in order due to dependencies:

1. **Task 5.1** (Cycle Management) - Creates cycle tracking foundation
2. **Task 5.2** (Agent Transitions) - Uses cycle IDs and metrics from 5.1
3. **Task 5.3** (Integration Testing) - Validates systems from 5.1 and 5.2

## Critical Success Criteria

### Cycle Protection
- [ ] Max 2 cycles strictly enforced (no Cycle 3)
- [ ] Escalation triggers at correct thresholds
- [ ] Cycle ID passed correctly between agents
- [ ] Iteration counter tracks accurately
- [ ] No infinite loops possible

### Agent Integration
- [ ] All upstream transitions documented
- [ ] All downstream transitions functional
- [ ] Automatic recommendations generated
- [ ] Invocation examples valid
- [ ] Cycle context preserved across invocations

### Testing
- [ ] All 6 integration tests pass
- [ ] Real reviewer integration successful
- [ ] Escalation mechanism validated
- [ ] Performance within targets

---

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Cycle ID Synchronization** (Medium)
   - Risk: Cycle ID lost between agent invocations
   - Mitigation: Pass cycle ID in both prompt and context
   - Impact: High if lost (cycle tracking breaks)

2. **Escalation False Positives** (Low)
   - Risk: Escalation triggers too aggressively
   - Mitigation: Conservative thresholds (50% improvement rate)
   - Impact: Medium (unnecessary escalations)

3. **Agent Transition Ambiguity** (Low)
   - Risk: Unclear which agent to invoke next
   - Mitigation: Clear priority-based recommendations
   - Impact: Low (recommendations are guidance, not enforcement)

---

## Integration Points

### Upstream Agents (Invoke review-consolidator)
- **plan-task-executor** (CRITICAL): After code changes
- **plan-task-completer** (RECOMMENDED): Before task completion
- **User** (OPTIONAL): Ad-hoc manual invocations

### Downstream Agents (Invoked by review-consolidator)
- **plan-task-executor** (CRITICAL if P0): Fix critical issues
- **pre-completion-validator** (CRITICAL if no P0): Validate completion
- **git-workflow-manager** (OPTIONAL): Commit clean code

---
