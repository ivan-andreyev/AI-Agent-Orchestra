### Test Case 10: Real Reviewer Output Parsing

```markdown

### code-style-reviewer Output Format
Expected: JSON with issues array
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "UserService.cs",
      "line": 42,
      "rule": "mandatory-braces",
      "severity": "P1",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "message": "Single-line if must use braces"
    }
  ]
}
```

Expected: Markdown with violations
```markdown
## SOLID Violations

### UserService.cs
- Line 15: Single Responsibility Principle violated
  - Severity: P1
  - Confidence: 0.85
```

</TestResults>
```

### Validation

- Action: review-consolidator generates report
- Expected: Report with 15 issues, cycle_id created

### Fix Phase
- Action: Mock plan-task-executor fixes 5 P0 issues
- Expected: Modified files, cycle_id preserved

### Cycle 2: Re-review
- Input: Same 10 files, same cycle_id (iteration 2)
- Action: review-consolidator re-reviews
- Expected:
  - 10 issues found (5 fixed, 0 new)
  - Improvement rate: 33% (5/15)
  - Cycle comparison in report

### Validation
- ✅ Cycle ID tracked correctly

- ✅ Improvement metrics accurate
- ✅ Cycle comparison section in report
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Cycle tracking functional across iterations
- [ ] Issue tracking accurate (fixed/persistent/new)
- [ ] Improvement rate calculated correctly
- [ ] Cycle comparison displayed

### Test Case 12: Escalation Trigger Test

```markdown
## TC12: Escalation Mechanism

### Setup
- Files with persistent P0 issues that can't be auto-fixed
- Mock executor that fails to fix issues

### Cycle 1
- 5 P0 issues found
- Cycle ID: consolidator-executor-1697123456

### Cycle 2
- Still 5 P0 issues (0 fixed)
- Improvement rate: 0%
- **Escalation triggered** (max cycles reached)

### Expected Escalation Report
- ✅ Escalation reason: "Maximum cycles reached"
- ✅ Unresolved issues: 5 P0 listed
- ✅ Root cause analysis performed
- ✅ Manual recommendations provided
- ✅ Alternative approaches suggested
- ✅ No Cycle 3 initiated (limit enforced)

### Validation
- ✅ Escalation triggered at correct threshold
- ✅ Report comprehensive and actionable
- ✅ Cycle protection prevents infinite loops
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Escalation triggers correctly
- [ ] Escalation report complete
- [ ] Root cause analysis functional
- [ ] Cycle limit enforced
