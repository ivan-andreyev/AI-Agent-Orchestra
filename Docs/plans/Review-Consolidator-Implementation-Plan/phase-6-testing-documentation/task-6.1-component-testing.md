# Task 6.1: Component Testing

**Parent Phase**: [phase-6-testing-documentation.md](../phase-6-testing-documentation.md)

**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Complexity**: 10-15 tool calls per test group
**Deliverables**: Component test scenarios with validation criteria

---

## 6.1A: Test parallel execution
**Complexity**: 10-12 tool calls
**Test File**: Create test scenarios in `prompt.md`

### Test Case 1: Parallel Launch Verification

```markdown
## TC1: Verify Parallel Execution Pattern

### Setup
- 3 mock reviewers (code-style-reviewer, code-principles-reviewer, test-healer)
- 15 C# files (10 regular, 5 test files)
- All reviewers configured to return after 30 seconds

### Test Steps
1. Invoke review-consolidator with all 15 files
2. Verify Task tool called 3 times in SINGLE message
3. Monitor execution timestamps
4. Validate all reviewers start within 5 seconds of each other

### Expected Results
- ✅ All 3 Task calls in same message (not sequential)
- ✅ Start time delta <5 seconds (proves parallel execution)
- ✅ Total execution time ~30-35 seconds (not 90+ seconds for sequential)
- ✅ All reviewer results collected successfully

### Failure Indicators
- ❌ Task calls in separate messages (sequential execution)
- ❌ Start time delta >10 seconds (delayed launches)
- ❌ Total time >60 seconds (sequential behavior)
- ❌ Missing results from any reviewer
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parallel execution verified (not sequential)
- [ ] Start time synchronization confirmed
- [ ] Total time meets parallel execution expectations
- [ ] All results collected

### Test Case 2: Timeout Handling

```markdown
## TC2: Verify Timeout Handling

### Setup
- 3 reviewers with different completion times:
  - code-style-reviewer: 45 seconds (success)
  - code-principles-reviewer: 320 seconds (timeout at 300s = 5min)
  - test-healer: 60 seconds (success)

### Test Steps
1. Launch parallel review with 5-minute timeout
2. Monitor reviewer status updates
3. Verify timeout detection for code-principles-reviewer
4. Validate partial result handling

### Expected Results
- ✅ code-style-reviewer completes: 48 issues
- ✅ code-principles-reviewer times out after 300s
- ✅ test-healer completes: 12 issues
- ✅ Consolidation proceeds with partial results (60 issues total)
- ✅ Report indicates timeout in metadata
- ✅ No blocking/hanging behavior

### Acceptance Criteria
- Total time ≤305 seconds (timeout + 5s buffer)
- Report generated despite timeout
- Timeout clearly indicated in metadata
- User warned about incomplete review
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Timeout detected correctly
- [ ] Partial results handled gracefully
- [ ] Report indicates timeout status
- [ ] No hanging behavior

---

### Test Case 3: Partial Result Handling

```markdown
## TC3: Verify Partial Result Collection

### Setup
- 3 reviewers:
  - code-style-reviewer: SUCCESS (20 issues)
  - code-principles-reviewer: ERROR (crashes after 10s)
  - test-healer: SUCCESS (8 issues)

### Test Steps
1. Launch review with error-prone reviewer
2. Verify error handling for crashed reviewer
3. Validate consolidation with partial results

### Expected Results
- ✅ Consolidation completes with 2/3 reviewers (28 issues)
- ✅ Error logged for code-principles-reviewer
- ✅ Report shows "2/3 reviewers completed"
- ✅ Recommendations generated from available data
- ✅ User notified of partial coverage
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Error handling functional
- [ ] Consolidation proceeds with available results
- [ ] Partial coverage indicated in report

## 6.1B: Test consolidation algorithm
**Complexity**: 12-15 tool calls
**Test File**: Create algorithm tests in `consolidation-algorithm.md`

### Test Case 4: Exact Match Deduplication

```markdown
## TC4: Exact Duplicate Detection

### Input Data
Reviewer 1 (code-style):
- Issue: Missing braces at UserService.cs:42 (P1, confidence 0.95)

Reviewer 2 (code-principles):
- Issue: Missing braces at UserService.cs:42 (P1, confidence 0.95)

Reviewer 3 (test-healer):
- No matching issue

### Expected Consolidation
- **Deduplicated to 1 issue**
- File: UserService.cs:42
- Priority: P1 (ANY rule → highest priority)
- Confidence: 0.95 (average of 0.95, 0.95)
- Reviewers: [code-style-reviewer, code-principles-reviewer]
- Agreement: 67% (2/3 reviewers)

### Validation
- ✅ 2 input issues → 1 output issue
- ✅ Confidence correctly averaged
- ✅ Reviewer list complete
- ✅ Agreement percentage accurate
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Exact duplicates detected
- [ ] Deduplication reduces issue count
- [ ] Confidence calculation accurate

### Test Case 5: Semantic Similarity Grouping

```markdown
## TC5: Similar Issue Grouping

### Input Data
Issue A (code-style):
- File: AuthController.cs:45
- Message: "Variable name 'u' should be descriptive"
- Priority: P2, Confidence: 0.80

Issue B (code-principles):
- File: AuthController.cs:47
- Message: "Variable 'u' violates naming convention"
- Priority: P1, Confidence: 0.85

### Similarity Calculation
- File match: AuthController.cs (same file = +0.3)
- Line proximity: 45 vs 47 (2 lines apart = +0.2)
- Message similarity: Levenshtein ~75% (+0.375)
- **Total similarity**: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.375 = 0.875 (>0.80 threshold)

### Expected Consolidation
- **Grouped as 1 issue**
- File: AuthController.cs:45-47
- Message: "Variable 'u' violates naming convention (should be descriptive)"
- Priority: P1 (from code-principles, higher priority)
- Confidence: 0.825 (weighted average)
- Reviewers: [code-style-reviewer, code-principles-reviewer]

### Validation
- ✅ Similarity correctly calculated
- ✅ Issues grouped despite different lines
- ✅ Higher priority wins (P1 over P2)
- ✅ Message merged meaningfully
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Semantic similarity calculation accurate
- [ ] Grouping threshold applied correctly
- [ ] Priority aggregation follows rules
- [ ] Message merging meaningful

### Test Case 6: Priority Aggregation Rules

```markdown
## TC6: Priority Aggregation Logic

### Test 6A: ANY P0 Rule
Input: 3 reviewers report same issue with priorities [P0, P1, P2]
Expected: Consolidated priority = P0 (any P0 wins)

### Test 6B: MAJORITY P1 Rule
Input: 3 reviewers report same issue with priorities [P1, P1, P2]
Expected: Consolidated priority = P1 (2/3 = 67% ≥ 50%)

### Test 6C: DEFAULT P2 Rule
Input: 3 reviewers report same issue with priorities [P2, P2, P2]
Expected: Consolidated priority = P2 (all agree)

### Test 6D: No Majority
Input: 3 reviewers report same issue with priorities [P1, P2, P2]
Expected: Consolidated priority = P2 (P1 only 33% < 50%)

### Validation
- ✅ P0 always wins if any reviewer reports P0
- ✅ P1 wins if ≥50% of reviewers report P1
- ✅ P2 default for all other cases
- ✅ Edge cases handled correctly
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] P0 ANY rule functional
- [ ] P1 MAJORITY rule functional
- [ ] P2 DEFAULT rule functional
- [ ] Edge cases validated
