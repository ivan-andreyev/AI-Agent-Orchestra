## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Optimization 1: Result Caching
- Cache reviewer results for 15 minutes
- Skip re-review if files unchanged
- Expected savings: 90% on cache hit

### Optimization 2: Early Termination
- Stop all reviewers if P0 found
- Immediate report generation
- Expected savings: Up to 50% for critical issues

### Optimization 3: Incremental Consolidation
- Start consolidation as results arrive
- Don't wait for all reviewers
- Expected savings: 20-30% overall time

### Optimization 4: Parallel Report Generation
- Generate appendices in parallel
- Concurrent file I/O
- Expected savings: 15-20% report time
