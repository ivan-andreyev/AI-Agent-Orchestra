## Success Criteria

- [ ] Master report includes all required sections
- [ ] Executive summary auto-generated from statistics
- [ ] Table of contents for reports >50 issues
- [ ] Emoji indicators and confidence scores displayed
- [ ] Code snippets with 5-line context included
- [ ] One appendix per reviewer with cross-references
- [ ] Traceability matrix shows complete issue lineage
- [ ] All files saved to correct locations (Docs/reviews/)
- [ ] Archival policy enforced automatically
- [ ] P0 issues trigger console notifications

---

## Validation Tests

1. **Report Structure Test**: 50 issues → all sections present, TOC generated
2. **Formatting Test**: Emoji indicators, confidence scores, code snippets correct
3. **Traceability Test**: 30 consolidated issues → all source issues mapped
4. **Appendix Generation Test**: 3 reviewers → 3 appendices with cross-refs
5. **Output Integration Test**: Files created in correct locations, index updated

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Formatting and file operations
- Mitigation: Comprehensive validation tests for markdown syntax
- Contingency: Fallback to plain text if markdown parsing fails

**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Estimated Completion**: 6-8 hours total
