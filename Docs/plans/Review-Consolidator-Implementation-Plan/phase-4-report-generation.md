# Phase 4: Report Generation & Output

**Parent Plan**: [Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md](../Review-Consolidator-Implementation-Plan.md)

**Duration**: Day 4 (6-8 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 (Consolidation Algorithm) complete
**Deliverables**: Report generation specifications and templates

---

## Overview

Phase 4 implements the comprehensive report generation system that transforms consolidated issues into professional, actionable documentation. This phase creates both master reports and individual reviewer appendices with full traceability, automated output management, and intelligent distribution.

**Key Objectives**:
- Generate master consolidated report with executive summary and prioritized action items
- Create individual reviewer appendices with full traceability to master report
- Implement automated file management with versioning and archival
- Achieve professional report quality with emoji indicators, code snippets, and metadata

## Task Structure

### [Task 4.1: Master Report Generator](phase-4-report-generation/task-4.1-master-report-generator.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours | **Complexity**: Medium-High

Generates the primary consolidated report:
- Executive summary with key statistics
- Priority-grouped issues (P0 Critical, P1 Warnings, P2 Improvements)
- Common themes analysis (top 5-10 patterns)
- Prioritized action items with effort estimates
- Auto-generated table of contents for large reports (>50 issues)
- Comprehensive metadata footer

**Key Deliverable**: Master report template and formatting logic

---

### [Task 4.2: Individual Reviewer Appendices](phase-4-report-generation/task-4.2-reviewer-appendices.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours | **Complexity**: Medium

Creates detailed appendices for each reviewer:
- Full original issue listings per reviewer
- Cross-references to consolidated master issues
- Rules/principles applied documentation
- Traceability matrix showing issue consolidation lineage
- Preservation of reviewer-specific context

**Key Deliverable**: Appendix templates with traceability matrix

---

### [Task 4.3: Output Management and Integration](phase-4-report-generation/task-4.3-output-integration.md)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours | **Complexity**: Low

Implements file management and distribution:
- ISO 8601 timestamp-based file naming
- Report versioning (incremental versions for same file sets)
- Archival policy (5 recent reports + archive >30 days)
- Console output with P0 notifications
- Searchable report index (index.json)

**Key Deliverable**: Output management specifications

---

## Dependencies

**Inputs from Phase 3**:
- ConsolidatedIssue[] array (deduplicated, prioritized)
- Recommendation[] array (themed, ranked)
- ActionItem[] array (sorted by priority and effort)
- Deduplication and aggregation statistics

**Outputs to Phase 5**:
- Generated report filenames for cycle tracking
- Report metadata for quality assessment
- Console output format for user communication

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Master report includes all required sections
- [ ] Executive summary auto-generated from statistics
- [ ] Table of contents for reports >50 issues
- [ ] Emoji indicators and confidence scores displayed
- [ ] Code snippets with 5-line context included
- [ ] One appendix per reviewer with cross-references
- [ ] Traceability matrix shows complete issue lineage
- [ ] All files saved to correct locations (Docs/reviews/)
- [ ] Archival policy enforced automatically
- [ ] P0 issues trigger console notifications

---

## Validation Tests

1. **Report Structure Test**: 50 issues → all sections present, TOC generated
2. **Formatting Test**: Emoji indicators, confidence scores, code snippets correct
3. **Traceability Test**: 30 consolidated issues → all source issues mapped
4. **Appendix Generation Test**: 3 reviewers → 3 appendices with cross-refs
5. **Output Integration Test**: Files created in correct locations, index updated

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Formatting and file operations
- Mitigation: Comprehensive validation tests for markdown syntax
- Contingency: Fallback to plain text if markdown parsing fails

---

**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Estimated Completion**: 6-8 hours total
