**File**: `.cursor/agents/plan-readiness-validator/README.md`

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Plan Readiness Validator Agent

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Type**: Validation Agent (Pre-Execution)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical for MVP)
**Status**: PRODUCTION

## Overview

The plan-readiness-validator agent automatically validates work plans for LLM execution readiness using a ≥90% threshold scoring system. This agent acts as a quality gate between plan creation (work-plan-architect) and plan execution (plan-task-executor), preventing costly execution failures and reducing review cycles from 1.5-2.5 hours to 10-15 minutes.

**Key Benefits**:
- **10-15x improvement** in review time (1.5-2.5 hours → 10-15 minutes)
- **90%+ automation** of plan validation (up from 50%)
- **<5% stage skip rate** (down from 20-30%)
- **Guaranteed ≥90% LLM readiness score** before execution

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Validate a work plan
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "plan-readiness-validator"
Parameters:
  plan_file: "Docs/plans/Feature-Implementation-Plan.md"
```

### Expected Output

```markdown
# Plan Readiness Validation Report

**Plan**: Docs/plans/Feature-Implementation-Plan.md
**LLM Readiness Score**: 93/100 (93%)
**Status**: ✅ READY

## Score Breakdown
- Task Specificity: 28/30 ✅
- Technical Completeness: 30/30 ✅
- Execution Clarity: 18/20 ✅
- Structure Compliance: 17/20 ⚠️

[Additional report sections...]
```

## When to Use This Agent

### CRITICAL Use Cases

1. **Before Plan Execution**: Always validate plans before invoking plan-task-executor
2. **After Plan Creation**: Validate new plans created by work-plan-architect
3. **After Plan Revision**: Re-validate plans after addressing review feedback
4. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Ensure ≥90% readiness threshold before proceeding

### RECOMMENDED Use Cases

1. **Parallel Optimization Check**: Identify plans with >5 tasks for parallel-plan-optimizer
2. **Architectural Documentation Trigger**: Detect plans needing architecture-documenter
3. **Pre-Review Screening**: Quick validation before manual work-plan-reviewer invocation

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Validating a New Plan

**Scenario**: work-plan-architect just created a new feature implementation plan

**Steps**:
1. work-plan-architect creates `Docs/plans/Feature-Authentication-Plan.md`
2. Invoke plan-readiness-validator:
   ```
   Use Task tool with subagent_type: "plan-readiness-validator"
   Parameters: plan_file="Docs/plans/Feature-Authentication-Plan.md"
   ```
3. Review validation report
4. If READY (≥90%), proceed to plan-task-executor
5. If REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT (<90%), invoke work-plan-architect with issues_list

**Expected Outcome**: Plan validated in <60 seconds with clear READY/REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT status

### Example 2: Iterative Plan Improvement

**Scenario**: Plan fails validation, needs revision

**Steps**:
1. plan-readiness-validator scores plan at 72/100 (REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT)
2. Validator provides detailed issues list (12 issues found)
3. Invoke work-plan-architect with issues_list parameter
4. work-plan-architect revises plan to address issues
5. Re-invoke plan-readiness-validator on revised plan
6. Plan now scores 93/100 (READY)
7. Proceed to plan-task-executor

**Expected Outcome**: Score improves from 72 → 93 after addressing issues (max 3 revision cycles)

### Example 3: Parallel Optimization Opportunity

**Scenario**: Plan has many tasks, parallel execution could save time

**Steps**:
1. plan-readiness-validator scores plan at 95/100 (READY)
2. Validator detects 12 tasks in plan
3. Validator recommends parallel-plan-optimizer (RECOMMENDED)
4. Invoke parallel-plan-optimizer to analyze parallelization opportunities
5. Optimizer generates parallel execution strategy (estimated 40% time reduction)
6. Proceed with optimized plan execution

**Expected Outcome**: Parallel execution reduces implementation time from 10 days → 6 days

## Understanding Validation Scores

### Score Components

**Task Specificity (0-30 points)**:
- Measures concreteness of task descriptions
- Checks for explicit file paths, class names, acceptance criteria
- **Good**: "Create `src/Orchestra.Core/Validators/PlanValidator.cs` implementing `IPlanValidator`"
- **Bad**: "Create validator class"

**Technical Completeness (0-30 points)**:
- Validates integration steps for Entity/Service/API patterns
- Checks for DbContext additions, DI registrations, migration workflows
- **Good**: Entity task includes DbContext.DbSet, OnModelCreating, migration commands
- **Bad**: Entity task only includes entity class creation

**Execution Clarity (0-20 points)**:
- Assesses task decomposition and complexity
- Flags tasks >30 tool calls for decomposition
- Validates "Plan ≠ Realization" principle (architecture vs. implementation)
- **Good**: Tasks with TODO markers, clear subtasks, dependency identification
- **Bad**: Tasks with full implementation code, vague descriptions, high complexity

**Structure Compliance (0-20 points)**:
- Validates catalogization rules (GOLDEN RULES #1, #2)
- Checks file size limits (≤400 lines)
- Verifies reference integrity (parent/child links)
- **Good**: Coordinator outside directory, phase files ≤400 lines, no broken links
- **Bad**: Coordinator inside directory, 650-line files, broken references

### Score Interpretation

- **95-100**: Exceptional plan, ready for immediate execution
- **90-94**: High-quality plan, ready for execution (may have minor recommendations)
- **80-89**: Adequate plan but has issues, strongly recommend addressing before execution
- **70-79**: Problematic plan, revision required before execution
- **<70**: Critical issues, comprehensive revision needed

### Status Definitions

**✅ READY (score ≥90)**:
- Plan meets LLM readiness threshold
- Can proceed to plan-task-executor or parallel-plan-optimizer
- Minor issues may exist but won't block execution

**⚠️ REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT (score <90)**:
- Plan below quality threshold for automated execution
- Must address issues before execution
- Invoke work-plan-architect for revision (max 3 iterations)

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "File Size Violation - Main file exceeds 400 lines"

**Cause**: Coordinator file or phase files exceed 400-line limit

**Solution**:
1. Decompose monolithic plan into phase files
2. Create subdirectory: `Docs/plans/{plan-name}/`
3. Split content into `phase-1-{title}.md`, `phase-2-{title}.md`, etc.
4. Keep coordinator outside directory as thin reference
5. Re-run validator

**Expected Improvement**: +5 points on Structure Compliance Score

### Issue 2: "Missing DbContext Integration for Entity Task"

**Cause**: Entity implementation task missing integration steps

**Solution**:
Add checklist to entity tasks:
```markdown
### Task X.Y: Implement {EntityName} Entity
- [ ] Create entity class: `src/Orchestra.Core/Entities/{EntityName}.cs`
- [ ] Add to DbContext: `public DbSet<{EntityName}> {EntityName}s { get; set; }`
- [ ] Configure in OnModelCreating: `modelBuilder.Entity<{EntityName}>()...`
- [ ] Create migration: `dotnet ef migrations add Add{EntityName}Table`
- [ ] Apply migration: `dotnet ef database update`
```

**Expected Improvement**: +5 points on Technical Completeness Score

### Issue 3: "High Execution Complexity - Task exceeds 30 tool calls"

**Cause**: Task too complex for single execution unit

**Solution**:
Decompose task into subtasks:
```markdown
BEFORE (45 tool calls):
### Task 2.1: Implement Complete Validation System
- [ ] Create 5 validator classes (5 Write)
- [ ] Implement 15 validation methods (15 Edit)
- [ ] Add 20 unit tests (20 Write)
...

AFTER (3 subtasks, each <30 tool calls):
### Task 2.1: Implement Core Validators (12 tool calls)
- [ ] Create PlanStructureValidator.cs (1 Write)
- [ ] Implement file size validation method (1 Edit)
...

### Task 2.2: Implement Advanced Validators (14 tool calls)
- [ ] Create TechnicalCompletenessValidator.cs (1 Write)
...

### Task 2.3: Add Validator Tests (15 tool calls)
- [ ] Create validator unit tests (5 Write)
...
```

**Expected Improvement**: +3 points on Execution Clarity Score

### Issue 4: "Plan vs. Realization Violation - Implementation code detected"

**Cause**: Plan contains full implementation code instead of architecture

**Solution**:
Replace implementation with TODO markers:
```markdown
BEFORE (Implementation):
public int CalculateScore() {
    int score = 0;
    foreach (var item in items) {
        score += item.Value;
    }
    return score;
}

AFTER (Architecture):
TODO: Implement CalculateScore() method
- Iterate through validation items
- Sum individual scores
- Return total score (0-100 range)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +3 points on Execution Clarity Score

### Issue 5: "GOLDEN RULE #1 Violation - Coordinator inside directory"

**Cause**: Coordinator file located inside its content directory

**Solution**:
Move coordinator outside:
```bash
BEFORE:
Docs/plans/feature-impl/Feature-Implementation-Plan.md  # Coordinator inside
Docs/plans/feature-impl/phase-1-foundation.md

AFTER:
Docs/plans/Feature-Implementation-Plan.md  # Coordinator outside
Docs/plans/feature-impl/phase-1-foundation.md
```

**Expected Improvement**: +5 points on Structure Compliance Score

## Best Practices

### 1. Validate Early and Often

- Run validator immediately after plan creation
- Re-validate after each major revision
- Target ≥95/100 for high-confidence execution

### 2. Address CRITICAL Issues First

- Focus on GOLDEN RULE violations (blocking)
- Fix missing integration steps (Entity, Service patterns)
- Decompose high-complexity tasks

### 3. Iterate Within Limits

- Max 3 revision cycles (per agent transition matrix)
- If score not improving after 2 cycles, escalate to manual review
- Document persistent issues for future improvement

### 4. Use Validator Recommendations

- Follow CRITICAL agent recommendations (work-plan-architect, architecture-documenter)
- Consider RECOMMENDED optimizations (parallel-plan-optimizer)
- Balance automation with manual validation (work-plan-reviewer)

### 5. Maintain Score History

- Track score trends across revisions
- Document what changes improved scores
- Build library of high-scoring plan patterns

## Integration with Other Agents

### Upstream Agents (Input)

- **work-plan-architect**: Primary source of plans to validate
- **work-plan-reviewer**: May trigger validation after manual review

### Downstream Agents (Output)

- **plan-task-executor**: Receives READY plans for execution
- **work-plan-architect**: Receives REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT plans for revision
- **architecture-documenter**: Triggered for plans with architectural components
- **parallel-plan-optimizer**: Triggered for plans with >5 tasks

### Agent Transition Matrix Position

```
work-plan-architect → plan-readiness-validator → {
    if score ≥90: plan-task-executor (CRITICAL)
    if score <90: work-plan-architect (CRITICAL, max 3 iterations)
    if has_architectural_components: architecture-documenter (CRITICAL)
    if task_count >5: parallel-plan-optimizer (RECOMMENDED)
}
```

## Limitations and Edge Cases

### Known Limitations

1. **Business Logic Validation**: Cannot validate domain-specific correctness
2. **Heuristic Complexity Estimation**: Tool call estimation is approximate (±5 calls)
3. **Language Limitations**: English-only validation (Russian content not analyzed)
4. **Context-Dependent Scoring**: Cannot assess stakeholder-specific preferences

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Plans**: Flagged as REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT, score 0 on execution clarity
2. **Large Coordinators**: File size violation but may still pass if phase files compliant
3. **Broken References**: Structure compliance deduction, detailed error messages
4. **Circular References**: Warning issued, recommendation to remove phase-to-phase links
5. **Mixed Architecture/Implementation**: Execution clarity deduction for implementation code

## Performance Characteristics

### Validation Time Targets

- **Small Plans** (1-3 files): <15 seconds
- **Medium Plans** (4-7 files): <30 seconds
- **Large Plans** (8-15 files): <60 seconds
- **Very Large Plans** (>15 files): <90 seconds

### Accuracy Metrics

- **Agreement with Manual Review**: ≥95%
- **False Positive Rate**: <10%
- **False Negative Rate**: <5%
- **Issue Detection Recall**: ≥90%

Results: Plan Validation Checkpoint added (69 lines), Automated Validation Support added (127 lines), LLM Readiness Validation workflow integrated (182 lines), all cross-references use correct .cursor/agents/plan-readiness-validator/ path, max 3 iteration cycle protection consistently applied

### Objectives

Update project rule files to cross-reference plan-readiness-validator agent. Add validator references to common-plan-generator.mdc, common-plan-reviewer.mdc, and work-plan-architect prompt.

### Deliverables

#### 5.3.1 common-plan-generator.mdc Update

**File**: `.cursor/rules/common-plan-generator.mdc`

**Add Section** (after plan structure rules):

```markdown
## Plan Validation Checkpoint

**Automated Validation**: Before execution, all plans MUST be validated by plan-readiness-validator agent.

**Validation Process**:
1. work-plan-architect creates plan
2. plan-readiness-validator validates plan (≥90% threshold)
3. If READY: Proceed to plan-task-executor
4. If REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT: Revise plan (max 3 iterations)

**Quality Standards**:
- **Task Specificity**: Concrete file paths, specific class names, clear acceptance criteria
- **Technical Completeness**: Entity/Service/API patterns with full integration steps
- **Execution Clarity**: Tasks ≤30 tool calls, "Plan ≠ Realization" principle
- **Structure Compliance**: GOLDEN RULES, file size ≤400 lines, reference integrity

**Validation Tool**: `.cursor/agents/plan-readiness-validator/`
```

#### 5.3.2 common-plan-reviewer.mdc Update

**File**: `.cursor/rules/common-plan-reviewer.mdc`

## Automated Validation Support

**plan-readiness-validator Agent**: Automated pre-execution validation

**When to Use**:
- **Before Manual Review**: Quick automated validation to catch structural issues
- **After Plan Creation**: Immediate validation for new plans
- **Post-Revision Verification**: Confirm issues addressed after plan updates

**Complementary Validation**:
- Manual review focuses on: Domain correctness, business alignment, stakeholder requirements
- Automated validation focuses on: Structure, technical completeness, execution readiness

**Integration**:
```
work-plan-architect → plan-readiness-validator (automated) → work-plan-reviewer (manual, optional)
```

**Benefits**:
