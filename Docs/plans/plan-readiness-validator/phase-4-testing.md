**Result**: {PASS if agreement_rate >= 95 else FAIL}
```

#### 4.1.2 Validation Against Manual systematic-plan-reviewer Results

**Validation Method**:

1. **Baseline Creation**: Run systematic-plan-reviewer (manual/PowerShell) on all sample plans
2. **Automated Validation**: Run plan-readiness-validator on same sample plans
3. **Score Comparison**: Compare automated scores vs. manual scores
4. **Status Comparison**: Verify READY/REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT status matches
5. **Issue Comparison**: Check if same issues detected (≥90% overlap)

**Agreement Metrics**:

```
Agreement Rate = (Matching Results / Total Samples) × 100%

Matching Result Definition:
- Status matches (READY vs. READY or REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT vs. REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT)
- Score within ±5 points
- Major issues detected (≥90% overlap)

Target: ≥95% agreement rate
```

**Discrepancy Analysis**:

For each disagreement:
- Document score difference
- Identify root cause (scoring algorithm, pattern detection, edge case)
- Determine if calibration adjustment needed
- Record false positive/negative classification

#### 4.1.3 Accuracy Metrics (≥95% Agreement Target)

**Key Metrics**:

1. **Overall Agreement Rate**: {matching_results / total_samples} × 100%
   - Target: ≥95%

2. **Score Accuracy**: Average absolute difference between automated and manual scores
   - Target: ≤5 points

3. **False Positive Rate**: {false_positives / (false_positives + true_negatives)} × 100%
   - Target: <10%
   - Definition: Plans flagged as REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT but actually READY

4. **False Negative Rate**: {false_negatives / (false_negatives + true_positives)} × 100%
   - Target: <5% (more critical - missed issues lead to execution failures)
   - Definition: Plans flagged as READY but actually REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT

5. **Issue Detection Recall**: {detected_issues / total_manual_issues} × 100%
   - Target: ≥90%
   - Measures completeness of issue detection

6. **Issue Detection Precision**: {correct_issues / detected_issues} × 100%

**Test Steps**:
1. Invoke work-plan-architect to create new plan
2. Invoke plan-readiness-validator with created plan file
3. Verify validator receives correct plan path
4. Verify validator reads plan files successfully
5. Verify validator generates validation report

**Expected Outcome**:
- Validator successfully receives plan from architect
- Plan file path resolved correctly
- Validation completes without errors
- Report generated with status and recommendations

**Integration Issues to Check**:
- File path format compatibility (absolute vs. relative)
- Plan directory resolution (coordinator outside directory)
- Phase file discovery (Glob pattern matching)

#### 4.2.2 plan-readiness-validator → plan-task-executor Flow

**Scenario**: READY plan approved by validator is executed by plan-task-executor

**Test Steps**:
1. Run validator on high-quality plan (expected READY)
2. Verify validator recommends plan-task-executor as CRITICAL next agent
3. Invoke plan-task-executor with recommended parameters
4. Verify executor receives correct plan path
5. Verify executor begins task execution

**Expected Outcome**:

- Validator recommends plan-task-executor with priority 1
- Executor successfully receives plan handoff
- Execution begins on first task

**Integration Issues to Check**:
- Parameter format compatibility (plan_file parameter)
- Status interpretation (READY → execute, REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT → revise)
- Recommendation format parsing

#### 4.2.3 plan-readiness-validator → architecture-documenter Flow

**Scenario**: Plan with architectural components triggers architecture-documenter

**Test Steps**:
1. Run validator on plan with Entity/Service/Controller components
2. Verify validator detects architectural components (keyword detection)
3. Verify validator recommends architecture-documenter as CRITICAL
4. Invoke architecture-documenter with recommended parameters
5. Verify documenter creates planned architecture docs

**Expected Outcome**:
- Validator detects {component_count} architectural components
- Validator recommends architecture-documenter with type="planned"
- Documenter receives correct plan path and type parameter
- Documenter creates Docs/Architecture/Planned/{component}.md files

**Integration Issues to Check**:
- Architectural component detection accuracy (keywords)
- Parameter passing (type="planned")
- File path resolution for documentation output

#### 4.2.4 plan-readiness-validator → parallel-plan-optimizer Flow

2. Verify validator counts tasks correctly (### X.Y sections)
3. Verify validator recommends parallel-plan-optimizer as RECOMMENDED
4. Invoke parallel-plan-optimizer with recommended parameters
5. Verify optimizer analyzes plan for parallelization opportunities

**Expected Outcome**:
- Validator counts {task_count} tasks (expected: >5)
- Validator recommends parallel-plan-optimizer as RECOMMENDED
- Validator estimates time reduction (e.g., "40% reduction")
- Optimizer receives plan and generates parallel execution strategy

**Integration Issues to Check**:
- Task counting accuracy (### X.Y pattern matching)
- Time reduction estimation formula
- Recommendation priority (RECOMMENDED, not CRITICAL)

#### 4.2.5 Iteration Cycle: plan-readiness-validator → work-plan-architect (REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT)

**Scenario**: Plan fails validation and cycles back to architect for revision

**Test Steps**:
1. Run validator on problematic plan (expected REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT)
2. Verify validator generates detailed issue list
3. Verify validator recommends work-plan-architect with issues_list parameter
4. Invoke work-plan-architect with issues for revision
5. Run validator again on revised plan
6. Verify score improvement after revision

**Expected Outcome**:
- Validator generates REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT status (score <90%)
- Validator recommends work-plan-architect with priority 1
- Validator provides detailed issues_list for architect
- Architect revises plan addressing issues
- Validator re-validation shows score improvement (e.g., 72 → 93)

**Integration Issues to Check**:
- Issue list format compatibility (architect can parse issues)
- Iteration limit enforcement (max 3 cycles per agent transition matrix)
- Score convergence (revisions actually improve score)

   - If Task Specificity consistently over-scored: Increase penalties for missing paths
   - If Technical Completeness consistently under-scored: Adjust detection patterns
   - If Execution Clarity off: Calibrate complexity estimation heuristics
   - If Structure Compliance off: Adjust file size penalty weights

4. **Re-run Validation**: Test adjusted algorithm on same sample plans
5. **Iterate Until Convergence**: Repeat until average difference ≤5 points
