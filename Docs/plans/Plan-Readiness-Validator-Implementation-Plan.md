# Plan Readiness Validator - Implementation Work Plan

**Date Created**: 2025-10-14
**Completed**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (5/5 phases, 100%)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical for MVP)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Agent Type**: Validation Agent (Pre-Execution)

## Executive Summary

This work plan defines the implementation of the **plan-readiness-validator** agent, the second of three P0 agents required for the distributed autonomous agents architecture. This validator ensures work plans meet quality standards (≥90% LLM readiness score) before execution begins, preventing costly execution failures and reducing review cycles from 1.5-2.5 hours to 10-15 minutes.

**Business Value**:
- 10-15x improvement in review time
- 90%+ automation of plan validation (up from 50%)
- <5% stage skip rate (down from 20-30%)
- Guaranteed ≥90% LLM readiness score

**MVP Critical Path**: This agent is blocking MVP completion. Must be implemented before Dashboard completion and Actions Block Phase 3.

## Context and Dependencies

### Relationship to Existing Agents

**Completed (Reference Implementations)**:
- **systematic-plan-reviewer** (P0 agent 1/3) - Automated systematic review via PowerShell
- **work-plan-reviewer** - Similar validation logic, manual review focus
- **work-plan-architect** - Creates plans that this agent validates

**Pending**:
- **review-consolidator** (P0 agent 3/3) - Consolidates feedback from review army

### Integration Points

**Agent Transition Matrix** (from MASTER-ROADMAP.md):
- **CRITICAL** path: work-plan-architect → **plan-readiness-validator** → plan-task-executor
- **RECOMMENDED** path: **plan-readiness-validator** → parallel-plan-optimizer (if >5 tasks)
- **CRITICAL** path: **plan-readiness-validator** → architecture-documenter (if architectural changes)

**Workflow Position**: Pre-execution validation checkpoint between plan creation and execution

## Execution Strategy

### Development Approach

**Iterative Implementation**:
1. **Phase 1**: Design and specification (6-8 hours)
2. **Phase 2**: Core validation logic (8-10 hours)
3. **Phase 3**: Scoring and reporting (6-8 hours)
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and validation (4-6 hours)
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation (3-4 hours)

**Total Estimate**: 27-36 hours (aligns with 2-3 days in MASTER-ROADMAP)

### Parallel Work Opportunities

**Can be developed in parallel**:
- Phase 1.1 (agent.md) and Phase 1.2 (prompt.md) - independent
- Phase 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (validation components) - independent modules
- Phase 4.1 and 4.2 (testing) - can start during Phase 3

**Sequential Dependencies**:
- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 (design before implementation)
- Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3 (logic before scoring)
- Phase 3 must complete before Phase 4 (implementation before testing)
- Phase 4 must complete before Phase 5 (validation before documentation)

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Scoring algorithm inaccuracy
- **Mitigation**: Extensive validation against manual reviews (Phase 4.3)
- **Fallback**: Calibration adjustments and threshold tuning

**Risk 2**: Performance bottleneck (<60 seconds target)
- **Mitigation**: Optimize file reading, leverage caching
- **Fallback**: Increase target to 90 seconds if needed

**Risk 3**: Integration issues with existing agents
- **Mitigation**: Early integration testing (Phase 4.2)
- **Fallback**: Adjust agent transition logic if conflicts arise

## Notes and Considerations

### Design Decisions

**Decision 1**: Single-pass validation (max_iterations: 1)
- **Rationale**: Validation agent does not fix issues, only identifies them
- **Impact**: Faster validation, clearer separation of concerns
- **Alternative**: Iterative validation with auto-fix was considered but rejected

**Decision 2**: 90% LLM readiness threshold
- **Rationale**: Balances quality (prevents execution failures) with pragmatism (allows minor issues)
- **Impact**: Reduces false positives while maintaining quality bar
- **Alternative**: 100% threshold too strict, 80% too lenient

**Decision 3**: Leverage existing PlanStructureValidator.ps1 patterns
- **Rationale**: Reuse proven validation logic, ensure consistency
- **Impact**: Faster development, alignment with existing tooling
- **Alternative**: Rewrite from scratch rejected due to duplication

### Edge Cases and Limitations

**Edge Case 1**: Plans with no tasks (coordinator-only)
- **Handling**: Flag as REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT, score 0 on execution clarity

**Edge Case 2**: Plans exceeding 400 lines but properly decomposed
- **Handling**: Structure violation flagged, but may still pass if well-decomposed

**Edge Case 3**: Plans with broken parent/child references
- **Handling**: Structure compliance score deduction, detailed error messages

**Limitation 1**: Cannot validate business logic correctness
- **Scope**: Validator focuses on structure, not domain correctness
- **Mitigation**: Manual review still required for domain validation

**Limitation 2**: Heuristic-based complexity estimation
- **Scope**: Tool call estimation is approximate, not exact
- **Mitigation**: Conservative estimates, human override possible

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Machine learning-based scoring (train on validated plans)
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline (automated validation on commit)
- [ ] Visual plan quality dashboard (score history, trends)
- [ ] Custom scoring rubric support (project-specific weights)
