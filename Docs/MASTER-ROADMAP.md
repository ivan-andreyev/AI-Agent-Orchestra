   - Combine DI Refactoring with Remove HangfireServer Tests
   - Single infrastructure improvement initiative
   - Addresses same underlying issue

### Plans to Split

1. **Split Actions Block Refactoring**
   - Phase 1&2: Separate into "Critical Fixes" plan (MVP)
   - Phase 3&4: Keep as "Advanced Features" plan (Post-MVP)
   - Clearer prioritization and scope

### Plans Needing Revision

1. **Agent Coordination System Plan**
   - Status unknown, needs assessment
   - Should align with Claude Code integration
   - Requires clear acceptance criteria

2. **SQLite Database Integration**
   - Already partially implemented
   - Needs status update and completion plan
   - Should clarify remaining work

3. Focus 100% resources on critical path items
4. Implement weekly progress reviews

**Next Steps**:
1. Approve this roadmap with stakeholders
2. Begin immediate assessment sprint
3. Start Claude Code integration planning
4. Update all plan documentation
