# AI Agent Orchestra - Product Vision

## Mission Statement

**AI Agent Orchestra** is a unified platform for orchestrating, managing, and optimizing multiple AI coding assistants across development workflows. We transform chaotic multi-agent environments into synchronized, high-performance development orchestras.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**For Individual Developers:**
- Managing 3-7 different AI assistants simultaneously (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT)
- Context switching between different interfaces and tools
- No visibility into which agent is working on what
- Duplicated work when agents solve the same problems
- Lost productivity from agent coordination overhead

**For Development Teams:**
- No centralized view of AI assistant usage and effectiveness
- Inconsistent coding patterns across different AI tools
- Difficulty in scaling AI-assisted development
- No metrics on AI assistant ROI and productivity impact
- Coordination challenges in multi-agent environments

**For Enterprise:**
- Lack of governance and control over AI tool usage
- No standardization of AI-assisted workflows
- Security concerns with multiple AI integrations
- Cost optimization challenges across different AI subscriptions
