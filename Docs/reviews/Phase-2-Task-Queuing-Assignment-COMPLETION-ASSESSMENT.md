## üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS

### 1. ‚ùå FRAMEWORK-FIRST ARCHITECTURE BREACH (CRITICAL)

**VIOLATION**: Direct service calls bypassing Mediator pattern

**EVIDENCE**:
```csharp
// BatchTaskExecutor.cs - Direct dependencies injection
private readonly IOrchestratorService _orchestratorService;
private readonly IDependencyGraphBuilder _graphBuilder;
private readonly ITaskExecutionEngine _executionEngine;

// TaskRepository.cs - Direct database access without commands
public async Task<string> QueueTaskAsync(string command, string repositoryPath, TaskPriority priority)
```

**REQUIRED PATTERN** (from CLAUDE.md):
```
All business operations go through IGameMediator using Command/Query pattern.
Commands: {Action}{Entity}Command (e.g., PurchaseUpgradeCommand)
Handlers: {CommandName}Handler (e.g., PurchaseUpgradeCommandHandler)
```

**IMPACT**:
- Breaks established architectural consistency
- Eliminates command-driven traceability
- Prevents proper testing isolation
- Violates "No direct service calls" rule

### 2. ‚ùå MISSING COMMAND/QUERY SEPARATION (CRITICAL)

**REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION**:
- `QueueTaskCommand` + `QueueTaskCommandHandler`
- `GetNextTaskQuery` + `GetNextTaskQueryHandler`
- `ExecuteBatchCommand` + `ExecuteBatchCommandHandler`
- Event-driven communication: `TaskQueuedEvent`, `BatchExecutedEvent`

**CURRENT STATE**: All operations implemented as direct method calls

### 3. ‚ùå CODE STYLE VIOLATIONS (HIGH)

**EVIDENCE**: Code-style-reviewer found 3 critical mandatory braces violations
- Blocks missing braces despite project rule: "Mandatory braces: All block statements MUST use braces"
- Inconsistent with established codebase patterns

---

## ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS (75% COMPLETE)

### Core Task Queuing (90% Complete)
- ‚úÖ **TaskRepository**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for task management

- ‚úÖ **EntityFrameworkOrchestrator**: Database integration layer
- ‚úÖ **Priority-based queuing**: Tasks ordered by priority + creation time
- ‚úÖ **Repository-specific assignment**: Tasks assigned to appropriate agents

### Batch Operations (80% Complete)
- ‚úÖ **BatchTaskExecutor**: Sophisticated batch coordination with DAG dependency resolution
- ‚úÖ **BatchOperationsSection.razor**: Feature-rich UI with 3-step workflow
- ‚úÖ **Progress visualization**: Real-time batch execution monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Multi-repository support**: Cross-repository task execution
