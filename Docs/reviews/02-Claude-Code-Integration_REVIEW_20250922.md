## Executive Summary

The review analyzed three plan files addressing coordinator chat integration and context management. While the plans correctly identify real user problems and propose technically sound solutions, they contain **12 critical issues** primarily related to execution complexity violations, incomplete technical specifications, and structural inconsistencies. The plans require significant revision before implementation.

**Key Findings:**
- Both 02-07 and 02-08 plans violate the 30 tool call limit per task (estimated 45-60 tool calls each)
- Missing critical integration details for Entity Framework, DI registration, and SignalR configuration
- Incomplete risk assessment and testing specifications
- Structural naming inconsistencies with catalogization rules
