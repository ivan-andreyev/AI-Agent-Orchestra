## üö® PROGRESS METRICS
- **Total Files**: 5 (from filesystem scan)
- **‚úÖ APPROVED**: 2 (40%)
- **üîÑ IN_PROGRESS**: 0 (0%)
- **‚ùå REQUIRES_VALIDATION**: 3 (60%)
- **üîç FINAL_CHECK_REQUIRED**: 0 (0%) - (only during final control mode)

## üö® COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
**INCREMENTAL MODE**:
- [ ] **ALL files discovered** (scan to absolute depth completed)
- [ ] **ALL files examined** (no NOT_REVIEWED remaining)
- [ ] **ALL files APPROVE** (no IN_PROGRESS remaining) ‚Üí **TRIGGERS FINAL CONTROL**

**FINAL CONTROL MODE**:
- [ ] **ALL statuses reset** to FINAL_CHECK_REQUIRED
- [ ] **Complete re-review** ignoring previous approvals
- [ ] **Final verdict**: FINAL_APPROVED or FINAL_REJECTED

## VALIDATION FOCUS AREAS

### 1. CRITICAL SCOPE CREEP PREVENTION
**Validate the plan addresses the 600% scope expansion that occurred in Phase 3A:**
- [ ] True micro-decomposition (5-15 minutes per task)
- [ ] Explicit STOP conditions for each task
- [ ] Comprehensive "DO NOT" lists
- [ ] Single deliverable per task validation

### 2. LLM EXECUTION COMPATIBILITY
**Ensure tasks match actual LLM execution patterns:**
- [ ] Natural stopping points and handoffs
- [ ] Deliverables are validatable immediately
- [ ] Dependencies are clear and sequential
- [ ] No bundled operations requiring multiple sessions

### 3. SCOPE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT
**Verify STOP conditions are explicit and measurable:**
- [ ] Each task has specific completion criteria
- [ ] No ambiguous or open-ended completion states
- [ ] Clear validation checkpoints
- [ ] Exclusion lists prevent feature creep

### 4. COMPLETENESS AND COVERAGE
**Compare against original Phase 3 requirements:**
- [ ] All original functionality covered by micro-tasks
- [ ] No missing components or gaps
- [ ] Progressive build-up to complete feature set
- [ ] Integration points properly handled

### 5. DEPENDENCIES AND SEQUENCING
**Validate dependency chains are correct:**
- [ ] No circular dependencies or blocking issues
- [ ] Tasks can be executed in sequence without gaps
- [ ] Handoffs between tasks are clear
- [ ] Prerequisites are explicitly stated

## Latest Validation Results (2025-09-20 21:15:00)

### üéØ FINAL ASSESSMENT: APPROVED WITH MINOR RESERVATIONS

**CRITICAL FIXES VALIDATION**:
- ‚úÖ **Pseudo-Atomic Task Sizing**: FULLY RESOLVED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Foundation Dependencies**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED (count inconsistency: claims 18, shows 9)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LLM-Compatible Validation**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED (some browser verification remains)
- ‚úÖ **Session Boundary Alignment**: FULLY RESOLVED

**QUALITY SCORES**:
- **Structural Compliance**: 8.5/10
- **Technical Specifications**: 9/10
- **LLM Readiness**: 7.5/10
- **Project Management**: 9/10
- **Solution Appropriateness**: 10/10
- **Overall Score**: 8.8/10

**IMPLEMENTATION READINESS**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR EXECUTION**

**Next Actions**:
1. **TARGET FILE APPROVED**: 03-advanced-features-micro-decomposed.md ready for implementation
2. **Minor Corrections Recommended**:
   - Correct foundation task count inconsistency
   - Reduce browser-based validation where possible
3. **Continue with Other Files**: Other coordinator files still need validation

## Review Criteria

### APPROVE Criteria (‚úÖ):
- Tasks are truly 5-15 minutes with single deliverable
- STOP conditions are explicit and measurable
- "DO NOT" lists are comprehensive and prevent scope creep
- LLM execution compatibility confirmed
- All original requirements covered
- Dependencies and sequencing validated

### IN_PROGRESS Criteria (üîÑ):
- Some micro-tasks may still be too large
- STOP conditions need clarification
- Scope exclusions need strengthening
- Missing coverage areas identified
- Dependency issues found

### Key Success Factors:
- [ ] Zero scope expansion potential identified
- [ ] All tasks executable in 5-15 minutes
- [ ] Clear validation checkpoints at each step
- [ ] Natural LLM session boundaries respected
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage without gaps
