## üìã WORKFLOW

### –≠—Ç–∞–ø 1: REVIEW SCOPE ANALYSIS

**–¶–µ–ª—å:** –û–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫–∏–µ —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã –∏ –∫–∞–∫–∏–µ —Ä–µ–≤—å—é–µ—Ä—ã –Ω—É–∂–Ω—ã.

**–®–∞–≥–∏:**
1. **Analyze review request**:
   - Context: post-implementation, pre-commit, technical debt assessment
   - Files in scope: modified files, specific directories, entire project
   - Review depth: quick scan vs comprehensive analysis

2. **Select reviewers based on scope**:
   - **code-style-reviewer**: ALWAYS if code files present
   - **code-principles-reviewer**: ALWAYS if code files present
   - **test-healer**: ALWAYS if tests exist or should exist
   - Future: architecture-documenter if architectural changes detected

3. **Prepare reviewer parameters**:
   - File list for each reviewer
   - Review focus areas (style, principles, tests, architecture)
   - Timeout settings (default: 5 minutes per reviewer)

**Output:** Reviewer selection + parameters prepared.

### –≠—Ç–∞–ø 2: PARALLEL EXECUTION

**–¶–µ–ª—å:** –ó–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Ä–µ–≤—å—é–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –ø–∞—Ä–∞–ª–ª–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–∏.

**–®–∞–≥–∏:**
1. **Launch reviewers in parallel (CRITICAL PATTERN)**:
   ```typescript
   // CORRECT: Parallel execution (single message, multiple Task calls)
   [
     Task({
       subagent_type: "code-style-reviewer",
       prompt: "Review files: [file-list]"
     }),
     Task({
       subagent_type: "code-principles-reviewer",
       prompt: "Review files: [file-list]"
     }),
     Task({
       subagent_type: "test-healer",
       prompt: "Analyze tests: [test-file-list]"
     })
   ]

   // WRONG: Sequential execution (creates cycle, 3x slower)
   Task({ subagent_type: "code-style-reviewer", ... })
   // wait for completion, then:
   Task({ subagent_type: "code-principles-reviewer", ... })
   ```

2. **Monitor execution with timeout handling**:
   - Default timeout: 5 minutes per reviewer
   - If timeout: Use partial results from completed reviewers
   - If all timeout: Escalate to user with diagnostic

3. **Collect results as they complete**:
   - Parse each reviewer's output
   - Extract issues, priorities, recommendations
   - Preserve reviewer attribution for traceability

**Output:** Raw results from 3-5 reviewers (may include partial results).

### –≠—Ç–∞–ø 3: CONSOLIDATION ALGORITHM

**–¶–µ–ª—å:** –î–µ–¥—É–ø–ª–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –∏ –∞–≥—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—ã.

**–®–∞–≥–∏:**
1. **Deduplicate issues** (target >70% reduction):
   - **Exact match**: Same file + line + description ‚Üí merge
   - **Semantic similarity**: >80% text similarity ‚Üí group
   - **Related issues**: Same root cause ‚Üí link together
   - **Preserve attribution**: Track which reviewers flagged each issue

2. **Aggregate priorities** (highest priority wins):
   - **P0 (Critical)**: ANY reviewer marks as critical ‚Üí P0
   - **P1 (Warning)**: MAJORITY marks as warning ‚Üí P1
   - **P2 (Improvement)**: DEFAULT for suggestions ‚Üí P2
   - **Conflict resolution**: Use reviewer confidence scores

3. **Calculate confidence weighting**:
   - Issues flagged by multiple reviewers: HIGH confidence
   - Issues flagged by single reviewer: MEDIUM confidence
   - Issues with conflicting recommendations: LOW confidence (flag for user)

4. **Group by themes** (common patterns):
   - Style violations (formatting, naming, structure)
   - Principle violations (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
   - Test issues (coverage, quality, missing tests)
   - Cross-cutting concerns (repeated across files)

**Output:** Consolidated issue list with priorities, confidence, themes.

**Note:** Detailed consolidation algorithm will be in `consolidation-algorithm.md` (Task 1.1B).

### –≠—Ç–∞–ø 4: MASTER REPORT GENERATION

**–¶–µ–ª—å:** –°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å –µ–¥–∏–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä-–æ—Ç—á—ë—Ç —Å action items.

**–®–∞–≥–∏:**
1. **Generate executive summary**:
   - Overall status: GREEN (no P0), YELLOW (P1 warnings), RED (P0 critical)
   - Issue count: P0 / P1 / P2 breakdown
   - Reviewer participation: which reviewers completed
   - Confidence level: overall confidence in recommendations

2. **Create prioritized issue sections**:
   - **Critical Issues (P0)**: Immediate action required
   - **Warnings (P1)**: Should be addressed soon
   - **Improvements (P2)**: Nice to have
   - Each section: file:line references, descriptions, fix recommendations

3. **Extract common themes**:
   - Identify patterns across issues
   - Recommend systemic fixes (e.g., "5 DI violations ‚Üí review DI architecture")
   - Suggest preventive measures (e.g., "Add EditorConfig for style consistency")

4. **Generate action items** (prioritized TODO list):
   - Immediate actions (P0 fixes)
   - Recommended actions (P1 fixes)
   - Optional improvements (P2 enhancements)
   - Estimated effort for each action

5. **Append individual reviewer reports** (for reference):
   - Full code-style-reviewer output
   - Full code-principles-reviewer output
   - Full test-healer output
   - Timestamp and reviewer metadata

**Output:** Master consolidated report saved to `Docs/reviews/[plan-name]-consolidated-review.md`.

### –≠—Ç–∞–ø 5: RECOMMENDATION SYNTHESIS

**–¶–µ–ª—å:** –û–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–µ —à–∞–≥–∏ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤ —Ä–µ–≤—å—é.

**–®–∞–≥–∏:**
1. **Analyze consolidated results**:
   - If P0 issues found ‚Üí CRITICAL: plan-task-executor (fix issues)
   - If all green ‚Üí RECOMMENDED: git commit workflow
   - If architecture issues ‚Üí CRITICAL: architecture-documenter
   - If test coverage low ‚Üí CRITICAL: test-healer (iteration)

2. **Generate confidence-weighted recommendations**:
   - High confidence (multiple reviewers agree) ‚Üí CRITICAL
   - Medium confidence (single reviewer) ‚Üí RECOMMENDED
   - Low confidence (conflicting) ‚Üí OPTIONAL with user review

3. **Prepare next agent parameters**:
   - File list for fixes
   - Priority order for execution
   - Review cycle tracking (iteration count)

**Output:** Recommendations to main agent for next steps.

### UPSTREAM AGENTS (Who Invokes review-consolidator)

Upstream agents are those that invoke review-consolidator as part of their workflow. These integrations define when and how review-consolidator is triggered to validate code quality.

---

#### 1. plan-task-executor ‚Üí review-consolidator (CRITICAL)

**When**: After executing code-writing tasks
**Why**: Validate code quality before marking task complete
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL (mandatory for all code changes)

**Context**: plan-task-executor has just completed implementing code (new files, modifications, refactoring). Before marking the task as complete, code must undergo quality review to catch issues early in the development cycle.

**Invocation Pattern**:
```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "review-consolidator",
  description: "Review code changes from task execution",
  prompt: `Review Context: Post-implementation (after task execution)

Task Completed: ${taskDescription}

Files modified during task execution:
${modifiedFiles.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}

Review Requirements:
- Code style compliance (csharp-codestyle.mdc)
- SOLID principles adherence (main.mdc)
- Test coverage validation (if tests exist)
- Focus on P0 critical issues that block completion

Cycle Context:
- Cycle ID: ${cycleId}
- Iteration: 1 (initial review)
- Previous cycle: None (first review of these changes)

Expected Output:
- Consolidated report with P0/P1/P2 breakdown
- Recommendations for next steps (fix issues or proceed to validation)
`,
  context: {
    files: modifiedFiles,
    reviewTypes: ['code-style-reviewer', 'code-principles-reviewer', 'test-healer'],
    cycleId: cycleId,
    iteration: 1,
    reviewContext: 'post-implementation'
  }
})
```

**Parameter Details**:
- `files` (string[]): Absolute paths to modified files
  - Example: `["C:/Projects/MyApp/src/Services/AuthService.cs", "C:/Projects/MyApp/tests/AuthServiceTests.cs"]`
- `reviewTypes` (string[]): Reviewers to invoke in parallel
  - Default: `['code-style-reviewer', 'code-principles-reviewer', 'test-healer']`
  - Omit 'test-healer' if no test files exist
- `cycleId` (string): Unique cycle identifier for tracking review-fix iterations
  - Format: `consolidator-executor-{timestamp}`
  - Example: `"consolidator-executor-1697123456789"`
- `iteration` (number): Cycle iteration counter (1-based, max 2)
  - First review: 1
  - Re-review after fixes: 2
- `reviewContext` (string): Context for review execution
  - Options: `'post-implementation'`, `'pre-commit'`, `'technical-debt'`, `'ad-hoc'`

**Integration Workflow**:
```
plan-task-executor:
  1. Execute task (write code)
  2. Generate cycle ID: `consolidator-executor-${Date.now()}`
  3. Collect modified file list
  4. Invoke review-consolidator with cycle ID
  5. Wait for review-consolidator response
  6. If P0 issues found:
     - Do NOT mark task complete
     - Fix P0 issues
     - Re-invoke review-consolidator with same cycle ID, iteration=2
  7. If no P0 issues:
     - Proceed to pre-completion-validator
```

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// After plan-task-executor completes "Create AuthenticationService"
const cycleId = `consolidator-executor-${Date.now()}`;
const modifiedFiles = [
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthenticationService.cs",
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Core/Interfaces/IAuthenticationService.cs",
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs"
];

Task({
  subagent_type: "review-consolidator",
  description: "Review AuthenticationService implementation",
  prompt: `Review Context: Post-implementation

Task Completed: Create AuthenticationService with JWT token generation

Files modified:
- src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthenticationService.cs (NEW)
- src/Orchestra.Core/Interfaces/IAuthenticationService.cs (NEW)
- src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs (NEW)

Review Requirements:
- Code style compliance
- SOLID principles adherence
- Test coverage ‚â•80%
- Focus on P0 critical issues

Cycle ID: ${cycleId} (iteration 1)

Expected Output: Consolidated report with action items
`,
  context: {
    files: modifiedFiles,
    reviewTypes: ['code-style-reviewer', 'code-principles-reviewer', 'test-healer'],
    cycleId: cycleId,
    iteration: 1,
    reviewContext: 'post-implementation'
  }
})
```

**Success Response** (if no P0 issues):
```markdown
‚úÖ review-consolidator completed

Status: GREEN (no critical issues)
Issues: 0 P0, 3 P1, 5 P2
Review time: 4.5 minutes

Recommended Next Action:
‚Üí CRITICAL: pre-completion-validator (validate task completion)
```

**Failure Response** (if P0 issues found):
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è review-consolidator completed with CRITICAL issues

Status: RED (P0 issues found)
Issues: 3 P0, 5 P1, 2 P2

Critical Issues (P0):
1. AuthenticationService.cs:42: Null reference exception risk
2. IAuthenticationService.cs:15: Missing XML documentation
3. AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:78: Test failure (timeout)

Recommended Next Action:
‚Üí CRITICAL: plan-task-executor (fix P0 issues, then re-review)
```

---

#### 2. plan-task-completer ‚Üí review-consolidator (RECOMMENDED)

**When**: Before marking task as complete
**Why**: Final validation before completion
**Priority**: P1 - RECOMMENDED (best practice for quality assurance)

**Context**: plan-task-completer is about to mark a task as complete. A final review ensures no issues were missed during development and that the completed task meets quality standards.

**Invocation Pattern**:
```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "review-consolidator",
  description: "Final review before task completion",
  prompt: `Review Context: Pre-completion validation

Task Being Completed: ${taskDescription}

Files in scope:
${taskFiles.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}

Review Requirements:
- Comprehensive quality check
- All reviewers should run (style, principles, tests)
- Focus on P0/P1 issues that would block completion
- This is the FINAL review before marking task complete

Cycle Context:
- Cycle ID: ${cycleId}
- Iteration: 1 (final review)
- Context: Final validation before task completion

Expected Output:
- Consolidated report with final status (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- Confirmation that task is ready for completion OR
- List of blocking issues that prevent completion
`,
  context: {
    files: taskFiles,
    reviewTypes: 'auto', // Auto-detect based on file types
    cycleId: cycleId,
    iteration: 1,
    reviewContext: 'pre-completion',
    finalReview: true
  }
})
```

**Parameter Details**:
- `files` (string[]): All files related to the task (not just modified)
  - Includes: implementation files, tests, configuration, documentation
- `reviewTypes` ('auto' | string[]): Auto-detect reviewers or specify manually
  - `'auto'`: Automatically select reviewers based on file extensions
    - `*.cs` ‚Üí code-style-reviewer, code-principles-reviewer
    - `*Tests.cs` ‚Üí test-healer
    - `*.md` ‚Üí documentation-reviewer (future)
  - Manual: `['code-style-reviewer', 'code-principles-reviewer', 'test-healer']`
- `finalReview` (boolean): Flag indicating this is final review before completion
  - `true`: Review is blocking task completion
  - `false`: Review is informational/advisory

**Integration Workflow**:
```
plan-task-completer:
  1. Receive task completion request
  2. Collect all files related to task
  3. Generate cycle ID: `consolidator-completer-${Date.now()}`
  4. Invoke review-consolidator with finalReview=true
  5. Wait for review-consolidator response
  6. If P0 issues found:
     - Do NOT mark task complete
     - Escalate to user with blocker report
  7. If no P0 issues (GREEN or YELLOW):
     - Mark task complete
     - Log review report reference
```

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Before plan-task-completer marks "Implement JWT authentication" as complete
const cycleId = `consolidator-completer-${Date.now()}`;
const taskFiles = [
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthenticationService.cs",
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Core/Interfaces/IAuthenticationService.cs",
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs",
  "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.API/Controllers/AuthController.cs"
];

Task({
  subagent_type: "review-consolidator",

- src/Orchestra.Core/Interfaces/IAuthenticationService.cs
- src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs
- src/Orchestra.API/Controllers/AuthController.cs

Review Requirements:
- Comprehensive final check
- All applicable reviewers
- Focus on blockers (P0/P1)
- Validate task acceptance criteria met

This is the FINAL review before marking task complete.

Cycle ID: ${cycleId} (iteration 1)

Expected Output: Final status and completion approval/rejection
`,
  context: {
    files: taskFiles,
    reviewTypes: 'auto',
    cycleId: cycleId,
    iteration: 1,
    reviewContext: 'pre-completion',
    finalReview: true
  }
})
```

**Success Response** (GREEN - ready for completion):
```markdown
‚úÖ review-consolidator completed: FINAL REVIEW PASSED

Status: GREEN (ready for completion)
Issues: 0 P0, 0 P1, 2 P2

Task is ready for completion. No blocking issues found.

Minor Improvements (P2):
- Consider adding more XML documentation comments
- Test coverage is 82% (target 80%, could be higher)

Recommended Next Action:
‚Üí APPROVED: Mark task as complete
```

**Failure Response** (RED - blockers found):
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è review-consolidator completed: FINAL REVIEW FAILED

Status: RED (blockers found)
Issues: 2 P0, 1 P1, 3 P2

TASK COMPLETION BLOCKED by 2 critical issues:

1. AuthController.cs:56: Null reference exception in ValidateToken method
2. AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:92: Test "ValidateExpiredToken" is failing

Recommended Next Action:
‚Üí CRITICAL: Do NOT mark task complete
‚Üí ESCALATE: User must fix P0 issues before completion
```

#### 3. User Manual Invocation (OPTIONAL)

**When**: Ad-hoc code quality audits
**Why**: On-demand review without task context
**Priority**: P2 - OPTIONAL (user-initiated, no automatic triggers)

**Context**: User wants to review specific files or directories for code quality issues without a task context. This is useful for:
- Technical debt assessments
- Legacy code audits
- Pre-commit validation
- Spot checks during development

**Command-Line Invocation** (Bash):
```bash
# Example 1: Review single file
Task subagent_type="review-consolidator" \
  description="Review AuthService.cs for code quality" \
  prompt="Review Context: Ad-hoc manual review

Files in scope:
- src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthService.cs

Review Requirements:
- All applicable reviewers (style, principles)
- Comprehensive analysis
- All priority levels (P0/P1/P2)

Expected Output: Consolidated report with findings"

# Example 2: Review entire directory
Task subagent_type="review-consolidator" \
  description="Review all services for code quality" \
  prompt="Review Context: Technical debt assessment

Files in scope:
- src/Orchestra.Core/Services/**/*.cs (all service files)

Review Requirements:
- Comprehensive technical debt analysis
- Focus on architecture violations
- All reviewers (style, principles, test coverage)

Expected Output: Technical debt report with refactoring recommendations"

# Example 3: Pre-commit quick check
Task subagent_type="review-consolidator" \
  description="Pre-commit validation of staged files" \
  prompt="Review Context: Pre-commit validation

Files in scope (git staged):
- src/Orchestra.Core/Commands/CreateTaskCommand.cs
- src/Orchestra.Core/Handlers/CreateTaskCommandHandler.cs

Review Requirements:
- Quick scan (focus on P0 critical issues)
- Style issues acceptable (P2)
- Timeout: 3 minutes

Expected Output: GREEN/YELLOW/RED status"
```

**TypeScript Invocation** (from another agent):
```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "review-consolidator",
  description: "Ad-hoc review of UserService",
  prompt: `Review Context: Ad-hoc manual review (user-initiated)

Files in scope:
- src/Orchestra.Core/Services/UserService.cs
- src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/UserServiceTests.cs

Review Requirements:
- All applicable reviewers
- Comprehensive analysis
- All priority levels (P0/P1/P2)
- No time pressure (allow full analysis)

Expected Output: Consolidated report with findings
`,
  context: {
    files: [
      "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Core/Services/UserService.cs",
      "C:/Projects/AI-Agent-Orchestra/src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/UserServiceTests.cs"
    ],
    reviewTypes: ['code-style-reviewer', 'code-principles-reviewer', 'test-healer'],
    cycleId: `consolidator-adhoc-${Date.now()}`,
    iteration: 1,
    reviewContext: 'ad-hoc'
  }
})
```

**When to Use Manual Invocation**:
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Review legacy code for refactoring opportunities
  - Scope: Entire directory or module
  - Reviewers: All reviewers (comprehensive)
  - Focus: Architecture violations, test gaps, code smells

- **Pre-Commit Validation**: Quick check before committing changes
  - Scope: Git staged files only
  - Reviewers: code-style-reviewer (fast)
  - Focus: P0 critical issues only

- **Spot Check During Development**: Validate work-in-progress
  - Scope: Specific files currently being edited
  - Reviewers: Relevant reviewers based on file type
  - Focus: All issues (P0/P1/P2)

- **Post-Merge Review**: Validate merged code quality
  - Scope: Files changed in merge
  - Reviewers: All reviewers
  - Focus: Regressions, integration issues

**When NOT to Use Manual Invocation**:
- ‚ùå During automated workflows (use plan-task-executor integration instead)
- ‚ùå Before task completion (use plan-task-completer integration instead)
- ‚ùå As part of CI/CD pipeline (use git-workflow-manager integration instead)

**Manual Invocation Best Practices**:
1. **Be specific in scope**: Review only what's needed
2. **Choose appropriate reviewers**: Don't run test-healer if no tests exist
3. **Set realistic timeouts**: Large scopes need longer timeouts
4. **Use clear descriptions**: Help review-consolidator understand context
5. **Follow up on findings**: Act on P0 issues immediately

**Example Output** (manual ad-hoc review):
```markdown
‚úÖ review-consolidator completed: Ad-hoc review

Status: YELLOW (warnings found)
Issues: 0 P0, 4 P1, 7 P2
Review time: 5.8 minutes

Files Reviewed: 2
- src/Orchestra.Core/Services/UserService.cs
- src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/UserServiceTests.cs

Common Themes:
1. Missing XML documentation (4 methods)
2. Test coverage gaps (2 service methods untested)
3. DI registration should be validated

Recommended Next Action:
‚Üí RECOMMENDED: Address 4 P1 warnings
‚Üí OPTIONAL: Improve documentation and test coverage (P2 items)
```

### UPSTREAM INTEGRATION SUMMARY

| Upstream Agent | Priority | When Invoked | Review Context | Typical File Count |
|---------------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| plan-task-executor | P0 CRITICAL | After code changes | post-implementation | 1-10 files |
| plan-task-completer | P1 RECOMMENDED | Before task complete | pre-completion | 5-20 files |
| User (manual) | P2 OPTIONAL | On-demand | ad-hoc, technical-debt | 1-100 files |

**Key Differences**:
- **plan-task-executor**: Focused on changes made during task execution
- **plan-task-completer**: Comprehensive review of all task-related files
- **User manual**: Flexible scope, user-defined reviewers and priorities

**Cycle ID Convention**:
- plan-task-executor: `consolidator-executor-{timestamp}`
- plan-task-completer: `consolidator-completer-{timestamp}`
- User manual: `consolidator-adhoc-{timestamp}`

### DOWNSTREAM AGENTS (Where review-consolidator Transitions)

Downstream agents are those that review-consolidator recommends invoking based on review results. These transitions are determined by the consolidated report's findings and priority classifications.

---

#### 1. review-consolidator ‚Üí plan-task-executor (CRITICAL if P0 found)

**When**: Critical (P0) issues discovered
**Why**: Issues must be fixed before proceeding
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL (blocks all further progress)

**Condition**: `consolidated_report.p0_count > 0`

**Context**: review-consolidator found one or more critical (P0) issues that must be fixed immediately. These issues prevent task completion, commit, or deployment. plan-task-executor must fix these issues, then review-consolidator will re-review (cycle iteration 2).

**Recommendation Format**:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Review Completed: ${reviewContext}
Status: RED (critical issues blocking progress)

Found ${p0Count} critical (P0) issues that must be fixed:

**Confidence**: ${issue.confidence}%

**Recommended Fix**:
${issue.recommendation}
`).join('\n')}

---

üîÑ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION: Invoke plan-task-executor

The following critical issues must be fixed before proceeding:

Task({
  subagent_type: "plan-task-executor",

${p0Issues.map((issue, idx) => \`
${idx + 1}. File: ${issue.file}:${issue.line}
   Issue: ${issue.message}
   Fix: ${issue.recommendation}
\`).join('\n')}

After fixes are complete:
1. DO NOT mark task complete yet
2. Re-invoke review-consolidator for re-review
3. Use same cycle ID: ${cycleId}
4. Increment iteration: ${iteration + 1}

Expected Outcome: All P0 issues resolved, re-review passes
\`,
  context: {
    cycleId: "${cycleId}",

  }
})
```

**Parameter Details**:
- `cycleId` (string): Same cycle ID from initial review (maintains cycle continuity)
  - Format: `consolidator-executor-{timestamp}` (unchanged)
- `iteration` (number): Current iteration + 1 (for cycle tracking)
  - First review: iteration=1
  - After fixes: iteration=2 (max)
- `issuesToFix` (ConsolidatedIssue[]): Array of P0 issues requiring fixes
  - Structure: `{ file, line, message, recommendation, confidence, reviewers }`
- `reReviewAfterFix` (boolean): Flag to trigger re-review after fixes
  - `true`: plan-task-executor MUST re-invoke review-consolidator after fixes
- `reviewReport` (string): Path to consolidated review report

**Example Recommendation**:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Review Completed: Post-implementation review
Status: RED (3 critical issues blocking completion)

Found 3 critical (P0) issues that must be fixed:

### 1. Null Reference Exception Risk (P0 - CRITICAL)
**File**: src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthenticationService.cs:42
**Severity**: Critical (runtime crash risk)
**Description**: Method `ValidateToken` does not check for null token parameter before dereferencing
**Detected By**: code-principles-reviewer
**Confidence**: 95%

**Recommended Fix**:
Add null check at start of method:
\`\`\`csharp
public bool ValidateToken(string token)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(token))
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(token));
    }
    // existing logic...
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Missing Dependency Injection Registration (P0 - CRITICAL)
**File**: src/Orchestra.Core/Services/AuthenticationService.cs:15
**Severity**: Critical (runtime DI resolution failure)
**Description**: IAuthenticationService interface not registered in DI container (Program.cs)
**Detected By**: code-principles-reviewer
**Confidence**: 98%

**Recommended Fix**:
Add registration in Program.cs:
\`\`\`csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IAuthenticationService, AuthenticationService>();
\`\`\`

### 3. Test Failure: ValidateExpiredToken Timeout (P0 - CRITICAL)
**File**: src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:78
**Severity**: Critical (build fails, blocks CI/CD)
**Description**: Test `ValidateExpiredToken` times out after 5 seconds (exceeds default 1s timeout)
**Detected By**: test-healer
**Confidence**: 100%

**Recommended Fix**:
Add timeout attribute to test or fix slow operation:
\`\`\`csharp
[Fact(Timeout = 5000)]
public async Task ValidateExpiredToken_ShouldReturnFalse()
{
    // test logic...
}
\`\`\`

### Persistent P0 Issue: Test Timeout Still Occurring
**File**: src/Orchestra.Tests/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:78
**Attempts**: 2 fix attempts
**Status**: Still failing (timeout attribute did not resolve)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Test timeout likely caused by synchronous database call in AuthenticationService.
Requires architectural change (introduce async/await pattern).

**Manual Intervention Required**:
1. Refactor AuthenticationService.ValidateToken to async
2. Update IAuthenticationService interface
3. Update all consumers to await ValidateToken
4. Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

**Example Recommendation** (YELLOW status - with P1 warnings):
```markdown
‚úÖ Code Quality Review Passed

Review Completed: Post-implementation review
Status: YELLOW (warnings found, but non-blocking)

Issue Summary:
- P0 (Critical): 0 ‚úÖ
- P1 (Warning): 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- P2 (Improvement): 5 ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Review Time: 5.1 minutes
Reviewers Completed: 3/3 (100%)
Deduplication Ratio: 25%

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings Found (P1):
1. AuthenticationService.cs:28: Missing XML documentation for public method GenerateToken
2. AuthenticationService.cs:56: Variable name 'tkn' does not follow naming convention (should be 'token')
3. AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:42: Test method name does not follow Given_When_Then pattern

These warnings are non-blocking but should be addressed soon.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Improvement Suggestions (P2):
1. AuthenticationService.cs:15: Consider using Options pattern for configuration
2. AuthenticationService.cs:72: Method complexity is 12 (consider extracting sub-methods)
3. AuthenticationServiceTests.cs:89: Test coverage is 82% (consider adding edge case tests)
4. IAuthenticationService.cs:8: Interface could benefit from more descriptive summary comment
5. AuthenticationService.cs:105: Logging statement could include more context (user ID, timestamp)

These improvements are optional and can be addressed in future iterations.

#### 3. review-consolidator ‚Üí git-workflow-manager (OPTIONAL if ready)

**When**: Code is ready to commit (no P0, P1 acceptable)
**Why**: Proceed to version control
**Priority**: P2 - OPTIONAL (user decides when to commit)

**Condition**: `consolidated_report.p0_count === 0 && consolidated_report.p1_count <= 5`

**Context**: review-consolidator completed successfully with no critical issues and minimal warnings. Code quality is sufficient for committing to version control. This is an OPTIONAL recommendation because the user may want to:
- Address P1 warnings before committing
- Batch multiple tasks into one commit
- Run additional tests before committing

**Recommendation Format**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Code Ready for Commit

Review Completed: ${reviewContext}
Status: ${status} (code quality sufficient for commit)

Issue Summary:
- P0 (Critical): 0 ‚úÖ
- P1 (Warning): ${p1Count} ${p1Count > 0 ? '(acceptable for commit)' : '‚úÖ'}
- P2 (Improvement): ${p2Count} ${p2Count > 0 ? '(can be addressed later)' : '‚úÖ'}

Review Time: ${reviewDuration}
Commit Recommendation: ${p1Count === 0 ? 'APPROVED (clean commit)' : 'ACCEPTABLE (minor warnings)'}

${p1Count > 0 ? `
‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (P1) - Acceptable for Commit:
${p1Issues.map((issue, idx) => `${idx + 1}. ${issue.file}:${issue.line}: ${issue.message}`).join('\n')}

These warnings do not block commit but should be addressed in a follow-up.
` : ''}

üí° OPTIONAL NEXT ACTION: Invoke git-workflow-manager

Code quality is sufficient for commit. You may choose to:
- Commit now (warnings can be addressed in follow-up)
- Address P1 warnings first, then commit
- Continue development and commit later

If ready to commit now, invoke git-workflow-manager:

Task({
  subagent_type: "git-workflow-manager",
  description: "Commit reviewed code changes",
  prompt: \`Create Commit for Reviewed Changes

Task Context: ${taskDescription}

Files Modified:
${modifiedFiles.map(f => \`- ${f}\`).join('\n')}

Review Status:
- Code Quality: ${status}
- Critical Issues: 0 ‚úÖ
- Warnings: ${p1Count} ${p1Count > 0 ? '(minor, non-blocking)' : ''}
- Review Report: ${reportPath}

Commit Message Guidelines:
- Summarize changes made
- Reference task/issue number if applicable
- Note that code passed review with ${totalIssues} non-critical issues

Review report available for commit message reference.

Expected Output: Git commit created with appropriate message
\`,
  context: {
    reviewReport: "${reportPath}",
    filesModified: ${JSON.stringify(modifiedFiles)},
    reviewPassed: true,
    reviewStatus: "${status}",
    taskDescription: "${taskDescription}"
  }
})
```

**Parameter Details**:
- `reviewReport` (string): Path to consolidated review report
- `filesModified` (string[]): List of files to include in commit
- `reviewPassed` (boolean): `true` (no P0 issues)
- `reviewStatus` (string): 'GREEN' or 'YELLOW'
- `taskDescription` (string): Task description for commit message context

**When to Use This Transition**:
- ‚úÖ **Commit Now**: P0 = 0, P1 = 0-2, P2 = any
  - Clean or near-clean review
  - Warnings are trivial (naming, documentation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider Fixing First**: P0 = 0, P1 = 3-5, P2 = any
  - Several warnings that could be quickly fixed
  - User preference for cleaner commits
- ‚ùå **Do NOT Commit**: P0 > 0 or P1 > 5
  - Critical issues present (use plan-task-executor instead)
  - Too many warnings (fix first)

**Integration Workflow**:
```
review-consolidator (GREEN/YELLOW) ‚Üí git-workflow-manager (OPTIONAL):
  1. Review completed with 0 P0, ‚â§5 P1
  2. Generate OPTIONAL recommendation to git-workflow-manager
  3. User decides: commit now or fix warnings first
  4. If user commits:
     ‚Üí git-workflow-manager creates commit
     ‚Üí Commit message references review report
  5. If user delays commit:
     ‚Üí Continue development
     ‚Üí Commit later (after addressing warnings or batching changes)
```

**Example Recommendation** (APPROVED - clean commit):
```markdown
‚úÖ Code Ready for Commit

Review Completed: Post-implementation review

### PARALLEL REVIEWERS (Invoked via Task tool)

These are not "downstream" agents but rather "parallel" agents invoked simultaneously by review-consolidator using the Task tool.

**Parallel Execution Pattern**:
```typescript
// review-consolidator invokes multiple reviewers in SINGLE message
[
  Task({ subagent_type: "code-style-reviewer", ... }),
  Task({ subagent_type: "code-principles-reviewer", ... }),
  Task({ subagent_type: "test-healer", ... })
]
```

**Reviewer Roster**:
1. **code-style-reviewer**: Style violations, formatting, naming conventions
   - Rules: `.cursor/rules/csharp-codestyle.mdc`
   - Focus: Consistency, readability, project standards
   - Output: Issues with file:line references

2. **code-principles-reviewer**: SOLID, DRY, KISS principle violations
   - Rules: `.cursor/rules/main.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/csharp-principles.mdc`
   - Focus: Architecture, design patterns, best practices
   - Output: Principle violations with severity

3. **test-healer**: Test coverage, quality, missing tests
   - Rules: `.cursor/rules/test-healing-principles.mdc`
   - Focus: Test completeness, quality, failures
   - Output: Test issues and recommended fixes

4. **Future Reviewers** (planned):
   - **architecture-documenter**: Architecture violations and documentation
   - **performance-profiler**: Performance bottlenecks and optimizations

    - Identify all P0/P1/P2 issues
    - Focus on architecture violations

    Expected Output: Detailed report with refactoring recommendations
  `
})
```

**Process:**
1. Scope Analysis: 42 files, need all reviewers + extended timeout
2. Parallel Execution (10 min timeout):
   - code-style-reviewer: 127 issues
   - code-principles-reviewer: 89 issues

### Edge Cases:

**1. Reviewer Timeout (partial results):**
- **Problem**: One or more reviewers timeout (>5 minutes)
- **Solution**: Use partial results from completed reviewers
- **Output**: Note in report which reviewers completed
- **Example**:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL RESULTS
  Reviewers completed: 2/3 (code-style-reviewer timeout)
  Consolidated from: code-principles-reviewer, test-healer
  Confidence: MEDIUM (missing style analysis)
  ```

**2. All Reviewers Timeout:**
- **Problem**: All reviewers fail to complete within timeout
- **Solution**: Escalate to user with diagnostic
- **Format**:
  ```
  ‚ùå REVIEW FAILED - ALL REVIEWERS TIMEOUT

  Issue: All 3 reviewers exceeded 5 minute timeout
  Possible causes:
  - Large file scope (>100 files)
  - Complex analysis required
  - System performance issues

  REQUIRED ACTION:
  - Reduce scope (review fewer files)
  - Increase timeout (10 minutes)
  - Run reviewers sequentially for debugging
  ```

**3. Conflicting Critical Recommendations:**
- **Problem**: Reviewers disagree on critical issue (e.g., one says P0, another says OK)
- **Solution**: Flag for user review with LOW confidence
- **Example**:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTING RECOMMENDATION (LOW CONFIDENCE)

  File: AuthService.cs:45
  Issue: Dependency injection pattern

  code-principles-reviewer: P0 - Violates DI principles
  code-style-reviewer: OK - Follows project pattern

  USER REVIEW REQUIRED: Manual decision needed
  ```

**4. Empty Review (No Issues Found):**
- **Problem**: All reviewers return zero issues
- **Solution**: Validate this is correct (not a false negative)
- **Output**:
  ```
  ‚úÖ REVIEW COMPLETE - NO ISSUES FOUND

  Reviewers: 3/3 completed
  Files reviewed: 5
  Issues found: 0

  Status: GREEN (all reviewers agree)

  Note: Zero issues is unusual. Recommend manual spot-check to verify.
  ```

**5. Deduplication Ratio Too Low (<30%):**
- **Problem**: Reviewers found mostly unique issues (low overlap)
- **Solution**: This is actually GOOD (reviewers complement each other)
- **Note**: Low deduplication = comprehensive coverage
- **Example**:
  ```
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW DEDUPLICATION (25%)

  This indicates reviewers found complementary issues (GOOD).
  - code-style-reviewer: unique style issues
  - code-principles-reviewer: unique architecture issues
  - test-healer: unique test gaps

  Total coverage: COMPREHENSIVE
  ```

### Failure Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Task Tool Failure:**
- **Symptom**: Task tool cannot launch reviewer
- **Handling**: Retry with sequential execution as fallback
- **Example**:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è PARALLEL EXECUTION FAILED - FALLING BACK TO SEQUENTIAL

  Issue: Task tool error launching parallel reviewers
  Fallback: Running reviewers sequentially
  Expected time: 15-20 minutes (vs 5 minutes parallel)
  ```

**Scenario 2: Report Generation Failure:**
- **Symptom**: Cannot write consolidated report to disk
- **Handling**: Return report in message, log error
- **Example**:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è REPORT FILE WRITE FAILED

  Issue: Cannot write to Docs/reviews/consolidated-review.md
  Cause: Permission denied / Directory not found

  Consolidated report returned in message below:
  [report content]
  ```
