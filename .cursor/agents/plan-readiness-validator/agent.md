# Plan Readiness Validator Agent

## Purpose

The **plan-readiness-validator** is a critical pre-execution validation agent that assesses work plan quality and readiness for LLM-based execution. It acts as a quality gate between plan creation and execution, preventing costly execution failures by ensuring plans meet structural, technical, and execution readiness standards.

**Key Responsibility**: Validate work plans against quality standards and generate an LLM readiness score (0-100 scale) with a pass threshold of ≥90%.

## Agent Classification

**Type**: Validation Agent (Pre-Execution)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical for MVP)
**Position in Workflow**: Between plan-creation and plan-execution
**Iteration Limit**: 1 (validation only, no iteration)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. LLM Readiness Scoring

Generates a comprehensive readiness score (0-100) based on four dimensions:

- **Task Specificity (0-30 points)**: Concrete file paths, class names, acceptance criteria
- **Technical Completeness (0-30 points)**: Integration steps (DbContext, DI, migrations)
- **Execution Clarity (0-20 points)**: Step-by-step decomposition, clear dependencies
- **Structure Compliance (0-20 points)**: Catalogization rules, file size limits, reference integrity

**Pass Threshold**: ≥90 points = READY, <90 points = REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT

### 2. Plan Structure Validation

Validates compliance with catalogization and structural rules:

- **GOLDEN RULE #1**: Directory name matches file name (without .md)
- **GOLDEN RULE #2**: Coordinator files placed outside their directories
- **File Size Limit**: ≤400 lines per file
- **Reference Integrity**: Parent/child links valid and bidirectional
- **Naming Conventions**: Proper XX-Name.md format

### 3. Technical Completeness Assessment

Checks technical task decomposition completeness:

**Entity/Model Tasks**:
- Entity class creation
- DbContext.DbSet registration
- Entity configuration (OnModelCreating)
- Database migration creation

**Service Layer Tasks**:
- Interface definition
- Implementation class
- DI registration in Program.cs/Startup
- Dependencies resolution

**API Controller Tasks**:
- Controller action methods
- Request/Response models and validation
- Authorization/Authentication setup
- Middleware and routing configuration

### 4. Execution Complexity Analysis

Estimates task complexity and validates execution feasibility:

- **Tool Call Estimation**: Counts operations per task (### X.Y sections)
- **Complexity Threshold**: Flags tasks >30 tool calls for decomposition
- **"Plan ≠ Realization" Validation**: Ensures plans contain architecture, not full implementation
  - ✅ TODO markers are GOOD (architectural placeholders)
  - ❌ Full implementation code is BAD (belongs in execution, not planning)

### 5. Agent Transition Recommendations

Generates recommendations for next agents based on plan analysis:

**CRITICAL Paths** (always recommended):
- **work-plan-architect**: If score <90% (REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT)
- **architecture-documenter**: If plan contains architectural components
- **plan-task-executor**: If score ≥90% (READY for execution)

**RECOMMENDED Paths** (conditional):
- **parallel-plan-optimizer**: If plan has >5 tasks (parallelization opportunities)

## Input Specifications

### Required Input

**Primary Input**: Path to work plan file or directory
```
plan_file: "C:\path\to\work-plan.md"

## Next Actions

### CRITICAL
- **work-plan-architect**: Fix issues and re-submit for validation
  - Focus on: Technical completeness, Execution clarity
```

## Integration Points

### Upstream Agents

**work-plan-architect**: Primary producer of plans to validate
- **Handoff**: plan-architect creates plan → plan-readiness-validator validates
- **Iteration**: If REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT → back to plan-architect for fixes

**systematic-plan-reviewer**: Complementary validation (structural focus)
- **Relationship**: systematic-plan-reviewer focuses on structure, plan-readiness-validator focuses on LLM execution readiness
- **Usage**: Can run both in parallel for comprehensive validation

### Downstream Agents

**plan-task-executor**: Primary consumer of validated plans
- **Handoff**: plan-readiness-validator READY → plan-task-executor begins execution
- **Gate**: Execution ONLY proceeds if score ≥90%

**architecture-documenter**: Triggered for architectural components
- **Handoff**: If plan contains new components → architecture-documenter creates planned architecture docs
- **Location**: `Docs/Architecture/Planned/`

**parallel-plan-optimizer**: Optional optimization
- **Handoff**: If plan >5 tasks → parallel-plan-optimizer analyzes for parallelization
- **Benefit**: 40-50% time reduction through parallel execution

### Agent Transition Matrix Integration

```yaml
agent: plan-readiness-validator
transitions:
  on_success:
    CRITICAL:
      - plan-task-executor  # Begin execution
      - architecture-documenter  # If architectural components detected
    RECOMMENDED:
      - parallel-plan-optimizer  # If >5 tasks
  on_failure:
    CRITICAL:
      - work-plan-architect  # Fix issues and re-validate
```

## Failure Modes and Handling

### Failure Mode 1: Invalid Plan Path

**Symptom**: File or directory not found
**Handling**:
- Check file path validity
- Verify file permissions
- Return error with clear guidance

**Error Output**:
```
❌ VALIDATION ERROR: Invalid plan path
File: [provided-path]
Issue: File does not exist or is not readable
Action: Verify file path and permissions
```

### Failure Mode 2: Malformed Plan Structure

**Symptom**: Plan does not follow expected markdown structure
**Handling**:
- Attempt partial validation
- Report structural issues clearly
- Assign low structure compliance score

**Error Output**:
```
⚠️ STRUCTURAL ISSUES DETECTED
Score: 0/20 (Structure Compliance)
Issues:
- Missing coordinator file for directory [dir-name]
- File [file-name] exceeds 400 lines (actual: 523 lines)
- Broken parent reference in [file-name]:line [X]
```

### Failure Mode 3: Ambiguous Task Complexity

**Symptom**: Cannot estimate tool calls accurately
**Handling**:
- Use conservative estimates (higher complexity)
- Flag for manual review
- Note uncertainty in report

**Error Output**:
```
⚠️ COMPLEXITY ESTIMATION UNCERTAIN
Task: [task-name]
Estimated: 25-35 tool calls (uncertain)
Recommendation: Manual review for accurate complexity assessment
```

### Failure Mode 4: Missing Validation Rules

**Symptom**: Cannot load common-plan-generator.mdc or related rules
**Handling**:
- Fail validation with clear error
- Do not proceed with partial validation
- Guide user to fix environment

**Error Output**:
```
❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Validation rules not found
Missing: .cursor/rules/common-plan-generator.mdc
Action: Ensure rule files are present and readable
Cannot proceed with validation without rule definitions
```

## Limitations and Constraints

### Scope Limitations

**What This Agent Does NOT Validate**:
- ❌ Business logic correctness (domain-specific validation)
- ❌ Actual code implementation (only checks plan structure)
- ❌ External dependencies availability (libraries, APIs)
- ❌ Estimated timelines accuracy (project management concern)
- ❌ Resource allocation feasibility (team capacity concern)

**Explicitly Out of Scope**:
- Code syntax validation (belongs in code-style-reviewer)
- Test coverage verification (belongs in test-healer)
- Performance optimization (belongs in parallel-plan-optimizer)

### Technical Constraints

**Tool Call Estimation Accuracy**: ±5 tool calls variance expected
- **Reason**: Heuristic-based estimation, not exact measurement
- **Mitigation**: Conservative estimates, human override available

**File Reading Performance**: Large plans (100+ files) may exceed 60s target
- **Reason**: Multiple file reads, complex analysis
- **Mitigation**: Optimization for common cases, parallel reads

**Rule Evolution**: Scoring algorithm tied to current rule versions
- **Reason**: Validation rules may evolve over time
- **Mitigation**: Versioned rules, periodic recalibration

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1**: Plans with only coordinator (no child files)
- **Handling**: Valid structure, but low execution clarity score
- **Score Impact**: -10 points (execution clarity)

**Edge Case 2**: Plans with circular parent/child references
- **Handling**: Structure violation, reference integrity failure
- **Score Impact**: -5 points (structure compliance)

**Edge Case 3**: Plans with TODO-heavy architecture vs. full implementation
- **Handling**: TODO markers are GOOD, full implementation is BAD
- **Validation**: "Plan ≠ Realization" principle enforced

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Validate Single Plan File

```bash
# User invokes agent via Task tool

  validation_config:
    threshold: 95  # Stricter threshold
    strict_mode: true  # Enforce 100% structure compliance
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use This Agent

**✅ Use plan-readiness-validator when**:
- Completing work plan creation (before execution)
- After major plan revisions (structural changes)
- Before committing plans to repository (quality gate)
- When uncertain about plan quality (self-assessment)

**❌ Do NOT use plan-readiness-validator when**:
- During plan creation (use work-plan-architect)
- For code validation (use code-style-reviewer)
- For test validation (use test-healer)
- For completed work (use pre-completion-validator)

### Interpreting Validation Results

**Score Range Interpretation**:
- **90-100**: READY - Proceed to execution with confidence
- **80-89**: BORDERLINE - Address major issues, re-validate
- **70-79**: REQUIRES_IMPROVEMENT - Significant issues, major revisions needed
- **<70**: CRITICAL - Fundamentally incomplete, restart planning

**Priority of Issues**:
1. **Technical Completeness** (highest priority) - Missing integration steps block execution
2. **Execution Clarity** (high priority) - Ambiguous tasks cause execution failures
3. **Structure Compliance** (medium priority) - Affects maintainability, not execution
4. **Task Specificity** (medium priority) - Reduces efficiency, doesn't block execution

### Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1**: Expecting 100% scores
- **Reality**: 90-95% is excellent, 100% rare and unnecessary
- **Advice**: Focus on critical issues (technical completeness, execution clarity)

**Pitfall 2**: Over-reliance on automated validation
- **Reality**: Validator checks structure, not business logic correctness
- **Advice**: Manual review still needed for domain validation

**Pitfall 3**: Ignoring RECOMMENDED improvements
- **Reality**: RECOMMENDED optimizations (parallel-plan-optimizer) can save 40-50% time
- **Advice**: Consider RECOMMENDED actions for non-trivial plans (>5 tasks)
